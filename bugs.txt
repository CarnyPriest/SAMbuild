Bugs in Pinmame that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------
(Note: Many of these bugs have been extremely difficult to track down and fix, 
       so it might be awhile before they can be corrected!)

#1)  Williams/Bally WPC: DCS sound still have some problems.
     (Don't use full volume (30-31) to avoid static noise)

#2)  Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME. The most
     important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser, and accurate
     real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a work around).

#3)  The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings. The
     printout will probably not work with other settings.

#4)  Saucer LEDs not implemented in AFM.

#5) The Williams/Bally WPC CVSD speech seems to have a different pitch than
    the real game. A strange thing is that the speech works better when
    background music is playing.

#6) The name and year for each game were taken from the internet pinball
    database and may not be 100% accurate!

#7) Some games have custom Alpha/Numeric layouts which may not yet be supported.

#8) Comma issues with System 9

#9) Dip Switches do not work for Williams System 3-6.

#10) System 7 games using a Speech board do not work properly.

#11) Data East 128x16 DMD support is not 100% accurate.
 
#12) Data East/Sega/Stern 128x32 DMD support is not 100% accurate.

#13) Data East/Sega 192x64 DMD support is not 100% accurate

#14) Certain System 11 games seem to have highly customized displays, and are not emulated properly.

#15) Following DCS Games have sound issues:
     a) Indy 500 - Sound dies on ball 2
     b) STTNG - sound stops for extra ball.
     c) The Shadow - Sound stops on every ball except the first until a trigger is hit.
     d) Judge Dredd - Sound Volume varies between different balls.

#16) Rapid Fire displays all 2 in the bottom display.

#17) DCS Playback appears to be warped on Windows XP Beta builds..
