What's new in Visual PinMAME:
-----------------------------

Version 1.32 (May 1, 2004)
--------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.32 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- the controller dislay will be moved to position where it is fully visible after a game was started
  (prevent not visible controller windows after a game has set the location to a position out of the desktop)
- added Controller.Hidden (bool) property to hide the controller window. The value is not persitent, hence
  will not stored in the registry and resets to 'visible' on every call to Controller.GameName (set only)

Version 1.31 (December 23, 2003)
--------------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.31 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- Please see "whatsnew.txt" for PinMAME version 1.31 enhancements!

Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
-----------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.30 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- Please see "whatsnew.txt" for PinMAME version 1.30 enhancements!
- Fixed the bug in the VPM-Setup-Program where the "Test" feature crashed under w9x
- Default synclevel is now 0 since many people are getting newer faster computers.
- Rom Aliasing: Older romset names will internally be converted to new romset names for backward compatibility

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-------------------------------------
The most prominent feature this time should be Tom's "SyncLevel"(TM),
which is a most delicate and interesting way of synchronizing two separate
Windows applications from one thread only!
In other words: Visual PinMAME decides how fast any other application
running in the same graphical environment will update its view...
need I say more?

- Added "SyncLevel" feature:
  'Controller.Games(Controller.GameName).Settings.Value("synclevel")'
  This will help to keep the Emulation in sync with any other thread
  running at the same time (like your favorite Pinball simulation software) ;)
  This should boost game performance even on lower-end PCs...
- went back to the orange display color everybody loved so much

Version 1.20 Alpha (August 24, 2002)
-------------------------------------
- switched to link zlib 1.1.4 instead of 1.1.3
- changed to use the mame .59 core and most of the mamew code (with some slight modifications)
  ("Not an ordinary change, but an ordinary bunch of work")
- added the 'Controller.ChangedLEDs' property
- added 'Game.Settings' property including the "settings"-object you receive
- added 'Controller.Settings property including the "settings"-object you receive
- by using Controller.Settings and Game.Settings access to nearly all MAME settings is available
  ('Settings.Value("name")=value' 
- the emulation thread is running at a slightly higher system priority now
- the display can be resized to every size you like
