Based on the 1995 hit movie, starring Tom Hanks and directed by Ron Howard.


Apollo 13 is the only game to feature 13-ball multiball, the largest multiball of any pinball game!


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


SELECTING GAME MODE : After starting a game, you have a choice of 'Regular' or

'Novice' mode. 'Regular' is the normal 3-ball arrangement. 'Novice' is timed play; the player has 2-3 minutes when any drained balls are autoplunged, and after the 2-3 minutes expires, the game is over when the ball(s) on the field drains.

You can start a game in 'League' mode by holding the left flipper button in while starting a game, and 'Wizard"' mode by holding the right flipper button in.

NOTE : If the pinball machine is set to free play, you may NOT get the 

'Novice' mode.

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1996. 3,450 units were produced.


Attack from Mars was not originally inspired by the movie 'Mars Attacks' as is commonly suggested. Brian Eddy had the concept long before the movie and it is mere coincidence that they emerged on the market within a year of each other.


Scores rollover at 100B; that score is then displayed as 00,000,000,000. The game remembers that you surpassed 100B, though, and will put the score in the right place in the high score list.


According to artist Doug Watson, the woman who modeled for the 'Marilyn Monroe' hostage in the backglass is a secretary who works at the Williams' office.


'Eat at Joe's' can be seen on the backglass.


Cows : Occasionally after shooting the Big-O-Beam or Tractor Beam, you will see and/or hear a reference to a cow. When this happens, hit the launch button repeatedly to hear lots of mooing sounds. If you do this for both of the ramps, you are qualified to play Cow Video Mode. You must still start Video Mode in the regular way, by completing Super Jets and then shooting Stroke of Luck. But instead of saucers landing, it will be big mooing cows! There are no special points for playing with cows instead of saucers, but because they are larger than the saucers, the cows are much easier to hit.


- UPDATES -


Version: 0.3

Date : December 13, 1995

- This is the first release of software for production of sample games.


Version 1.0

Date: February 5, 1996

- This is the release of software for production.

- Added lots of lamp effects, display effects, and sound effects.

- Added all of the German, French, and Spanish translations.

- Added the '1 Martian Bomb' award to the Stroke Of Luck feature.

- Added lots of switch compensation code.

- Implemented the family mode adjustment. This adjustment affects 4 phrases :

'We'll Blow The Snot Out Of You, Martian',

'Damn, You Some Ugly Martians',

'Germany Will Kick Your Martian Butt To The Moon',

'You Know, I Enjoy Killing These Martians'.

If family mode is adjusted ON, these phrases will not be said.

- Changed and added some audits.

- The start replay level was changed to go as high as 20 billion.

- Added a high score for 'Rule The Universe'.

- Added a "victory lap" feature for winning Rule The Universe.

- Added the 'Saucer Attack' video mode. This is an award from the Stroke Of Luck feature.

- Added the sneak attack feature. This is an award from the Stroke Of Luck feature.

- Implemented novice mode.

- The wire color/transistor information in coil test has been updated to show the correct information.


Version 1.1

Date : June 10, 1996

- The Loop/Gate has been modified to kick balls out of the trough immediately, and to kick balls out of the shooter lane immediately.

- Completing the MARTIAN targets when they are available but when the Martian Attack feature cannot be enabled (i.e. when Rule The Universe is lit) now awards 1 Martian Bomb instead of nothing.

- The 5 way combo was being audited for every combo past the 5th (i.e. 6, 7, 8, ..., etc). This has been corrected.

- Fixed the Ball Save adjustment to enable turning off ball saves.

- Modified some display and lamp effects.

- 100 billion scores and higher now display properly in high score to date, status report, and attract mode.

- The maximum shot value during Total Annihilation was changed from 500 million to 250 million.

- Total bonus is now displayed in the status report.

- In version 1.0, if super jets was running and a loop shot was completed (i.e. all three lights solid), a shot to the loop would divert the ball to the jets. This is not a bug, rather, a feature. This behavior has been changed so that a ball shot to a completed loop will not be diverted to the jets (thus making the 5-way combo a bit easier to obtain).

- A 'dirty pool' feature was added. If an attack wave is not running, and the motorized 3-bank is up, and the center trough switch (behind the drop target) is made, the player is credited with the next attack wave. This feature is awarded only once per player, per game.

- Stroke of Luck is now enabled via the bottom lanes even when it cannot be collected (i.e. during multiball). It still can't be collected during multiball, of course, but when multiball ends, Stroke of Luck will be lit if enabled in this way.

- If Super Jets was running when Rule the Universe was started, there was no way to start Rule the Universe again on the same ball (since super jets is a 'until end of ball' feature). If this case is detected, the super jets light is now spotted.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Playfield Layout :

1. Left Outlane : Standard. This and the other inlanes/outlane each has a yellow lamp with no text; completing all four lights Stroke of Luck.

2. Left Inlane : Standard. Balls can roll up the inlane beyond the switch and find the outlane.

3. Left Slingshot : Standard. Scores a whopping 3,570 points.

4. M-A-R Targets : A three-bank of standups with those fat green plastic covers, located along the lower left side of the playfield. A martian figure stands above this and every other martian target bank; during Martian Attack, these martians bounce like the 'Boogie Men' from Elvira.

5. Left Loop : Also called the Capture Loop. This is a TA shot, and has three yellow lamps to indicate your progress towards completing it. It is also a jackpot/Super jackpot shot, and a Combo shot. It is a double rollover switch. The ball leads over the Bonus X lanes, where it may be stopped or it may continue on out the right loop if the right gate is open.

6. Left Ramp : Also called the Big-O-Beam ramp. Has lamps for the same features as the left loop, except the lamps are orange instead of yellow. It has an entry gate at the bottom, and a made switch at the top. It returns the ball to the left flipper. This is the easier ramp of the two.

7. Lock Ramp/Hole : Normally this is a ramp shot which feeds the right habitrail and returns the ball to the right flipper. When Lock is lit, a diverter opens and catches shots, sending them into the Lock hole. The Lock hole is just a popper that kicks balls out onto the left ramp habitrail, returning the ball to the left flipper. This shot can be lit for lock 1, lock 2, lock 3, Light Lock, a Combo, or a Jackpot/Super Jackpot. The ramp entrance is narrow and steep, and requires a solid shot to make it all the way. The ramp has a gate, and shares its made switch with the right ramp.

8. T Target : Like the other martian standups, this one is between the lock ramp and the saucer. A martian figure stands above it.

9. Forcefield/Saucer : There is a motorized 3-bank of standups, like in 'Whodunnit', that can raise and lower. When lowered, it reveals behind it a drop target in front of a hole, and two standups on either side of it. The saucer targets are used during Attack Waves. The Forcefield targets are also used during Strobe Multiball.

10. I Target : On the right side of the forcefield, just to the left of the Stroke of Luck scoop, with another martian figure above it.

11. Stroke of Luck Scoop: A narrow scoop, at an angle similar to that of Final Draw in World Cup Soccer, but much farther back. It can be shot from the front directly, or balls may fall in here from the back when exiting the jet bumpers. The game sometimes discriminates between front and back shots; it is a back shot if a jet bumper or bonus X lane was last touched, and a front shot otherwise (This can be fooled by airborne balls). The shot can be lit for a pseudorandom Stroke of Luck award (yellow light), an Extra Ball (orange light), Martian Attack (white light), and Rule the Universe (blue light).

12. Jet Bumpers : The usual three in formation similar to those on World Cup Soccer, lit by GI and not controlled lamps. These are used during the Super Jets feature. Balls can exit below into the Stroke of Luck scoop, or between the two rightmost bumpers into the right loop. Also, balls very likely will enter back into the Bonus X Lanes a few times while balls are a-popping.

13. Bonus X Lanes : Two rollovers directly above the jets, that can be fed by either loop. These advance the bonus multiplier, advance the scoring of the jet bumpers, and award the regular Skill Shot.

14. Right Ramp : Also called the Tractor Beam. Has lamps for the same features as the left ramp. It dumps the ball onto the right habitrail and sends the ball back to the right flipper. This is the smallest ramp, and reminds of the right ramp from "Johnny Mnemonic". It has a gate switch, and shares its made switch with the lock ramp.

15. Right Loop : Also called the Atomic Blaster loop. Has lamps for the same features as the left loop. It sends the ball over the Bonus X lanes, and if the left gate is open, the ball should whiz out the other side; otherwise, the ball will land in the lanes/jet bumpers. It is also a two-switch loop.

16. A-N Targets : Two more standups along the lower right side of the playfield, with a martian figure above them.

17. Right Slingshot : Standard.

18. Right Inlane : Standard.

19. Right Outlane : Standard.

20. Plunger Lane : Autoplunger only. Sends balls into the top of the right loop, towards the bonus X lanes. Plunged balls do not touch both of the right loop switches, so it is still possible to score right loops even when balls are being autolaunched.

21. Launch Button : Obviously, it launches the ball, but it can also be lit for a Martian Bomb, and will flash when it is available. It is also used during the Video Mode, but does not flash then.


* Objectives : The main objective of AFM is to Rule the Universe. In order to begin this feature, you must complete 6 objectives : (1) Collect at least one Super Jackpot. (2) Start Total Annihilation at least once. (3) Start Martian Attack Multiball at least once. (4) Conquer Mars by completing all 6 Attack Waves. (5) Start Super Jets, by completing a certain number of jet bumpers. (6) Complete at least one 5-Way Combo.

Your progress towards completion of these six features is denoted by six blue lights just above the flippers. When the sixth feature is completed, Rule the Universe is lit at the Stroke of Luck hole. If any multiball is in progress, Rule the Universe will not be lit until multiball finishes. Shoot the SoL hole to start. See the section on Rule the Universe for details on that feature.


* Skill Shots : There are two skill shots available at the start of each ball, and immediately after Ruling the Universe. Pressing the launch button without pressing the left flipper button will launch the ball into the Bonus X Lanes, and one of the two lanes will be flashing. Use the flippers to switch the flashing lane. Passing the ball through the flashing lane scores a normal Skill Shot, worth 10M points and +5X to your bonus multiplier. Each successive Skill Shot is worth 10M more points than the previous.

Holding the left flipper button down while pressing the launch button qualifies you for a Super Skill Shot. The left loop gate will raise and allow the ball to whiz pass the Bonus X lanes and exit down the left loop. Shooting any ramp or loop will award 50M points and spot all 3 Total Annihilation lamps for that shot. Shooting any Forcefield target will score 50M and lower the Forcefield. Shooting the saucer hole, the Stroke of Luck hole, or the lock ramp/hole awards nothing for the skill shot. The value of the Super Skill Shot is fixed and does not increase. It can be scored on a shot even if all 3 TA shots have already been completed. The Hurry-Up associated with completing the third TA shot is not awarded when it is completed by the Super Skill Shot.

There is a brief ball saver available at the beginning of each ball. Scoring a Super Skill Shot, or making a shot which does not award Super Skill Shot, turns off the ball saver immediately. When going for the normal Skill Shot, the ball saver remains active as long as the ball is in the jets/bonus X lanes and remains on a little longer after the SoL kickout. The display will read 'Ball Saved / Return To Battle' and the quote 'Return to battle, soldier' will signify that a ball is being returned into play.

A jet lane will be flashing even if Super Skill Shot is selected. If Super Skill Shot is selected but the ball does not make it all the way around and lands in that flashing jet lane, a normal Skill Shot will be awarded. If the autoplunger is really weak and the ball doesn't even make it over the bumper area at all, then the Skill Shot will remain lit for about 5 seconds and you can collect it during that time by shooting either of the loops to get to the lit lane.

When any Skill Shot is awarded by traversing the flashing lane, that lane is also lit towards advancement of the Bonus X on the same shot.


* Total Annihilation : 4 shots, the two ramps and the two loops, each have 3 lights in front of them. The left loop shots are labelled 'Capture'. The left ramp shots are labelled 'Big-O-Beam'. The right ramp shots are labelled 'Tractor Beam'. The right loop shots are labelled 'Atomic Blaster'.

At the beginning of the game and immediately after Total Annihilation, all 12 of these lamps will be turned off, and the next lamp to be awarded will flash. Making a shot lights the flashing lamp and flashes the next lamp in sequence. The first shot is worth 20M; the second is worth 25M; and the third is worth 30M. These awards are available during regular, non-multiball play, and they are also available during Martian Multiball.

Cow Video Mode can be started by watching the animations on the Big-O-Beam and Tractor Beam; see 'Cows' for more details.

Making the third lamp on any given shot starts a Hurry-Up sequence. The saucer/forcefield is lit for 100M for a brief time, and then rapidly starts to count down, to a minimum of 25M. Shoot the saucer or forcefield (depending on whether or not the forcefield is up or down) to collect the Hurry-Up value.

The third shot to either loop will open the controlled gate to allow shots to that loop to exit out the other gate. This starts as soon as the third shot is made, and remains in effect until Total Annihilation is started or Super Jets is started.

After a shot has been completed three times, until Total Annihilation begins, shooting that shot again scores a 'Fleeing Bonus' of 10M. Fleeing Bonus is only awarded on a loop shot if the ball completely exits the opposite side of the loop; i.e. it must touch at least 3 of the 4 loop switches. The first three shots to a loop can be scored just by touching two of the four switches.

Starting another Hurry-Up while Hurry-Up is already in progress increases the value of the Hurry-Up to 300M; starting a third increases it to 500M; and starting all four simultaneously awards 1B immediately and also starts Total Annihilation. In general, when the last of the four TA shots is completed, the Hurry-Up is automatically awarded without having to shoot the saucer or forcefield, and Total Annihilation Multiball begins (The exception is that Hurry-Up is never awarded because of a Super Skill Shot). The Hurry-Up does not count down any faster if more than one is lit, so when 2 or 3 are running concurrently, you have plenty of time to collect it. Once started, the Hurry-Up continues to run until it is collected, even during any multiballs. The minimum value of the Hurry-Up is 25M; it will remain there for just a few seconds before the award times out completely.

During Total Annihilation, the 4 shots are all lit for jackpots throughout the round. The jackpot value begins at 50M and increases by 5M each time a jackpot is collected. In addition, an Annihilation Jackpot is lit at the lock ramp whose value increases each time a jackpot is collected. After collected, the Annihilation Jackpot returns to its base value plus 10M. If no jackpots have been added into the Annihilation Jackpot, then shooting the lock ramp awards a regular Jackpot like the other four shots.

Each successive start of Total Annihilation starts with a base value of 25M more than before. For example, the second Total Annihilation starts at 75M per shot. The value still increases by only 5M per shot made.

Total Annihilation is a 4-ball multiball. Play continues until down to one ball. The forcefield cannot be lowered during TA to start Attack Waves. Regular multiball cannot be started during TA. Combos cannot be scored either. Also, the controlled gates remain closed so that all loop shots are kept in the bumper area during Total Annihilation. The maximum Annihilation Award is 200M.

When TA ends, the 12 TA lamps all reset, and you can begin progress towards another Total Annihilation.


* Saucer Attack Waves : There are 5 countries under attack : the U.S., Italy, Germany, France, and England. You must first defend these 5 countries against the Martians; then in the final attack wave, you Conquer Mars yourself. When an Attack Wave is not in progress, pressing either flipper button will change the next country to be saved, which will be flashing.

The artifacts under attack are :

1. U.S. - Statue of Liberty ('We gotta save the Statue of Liberty').

2. Germany - Brandenburg Gate ('The Brandenburg Tour is in danger').

3. England - London Bridge ('Blymie, London Bridge is falling down, isn't it?').

4. Italy - Tower of Pisa ('Mama Mia, the Martians are straightening the Tower of Pisa').

5. France - Eiffel Tower.

At the beginning of the game, or immediately after an Attack Wave is completed, the Forcefield will be raised. Shoot the three Forcefield targets to lower it and reveal the Saucer behind it. The Forcefield can also be lowered by a Super Skill Shot or a Stroke of Luck award. On normal difficulty settings, shooting the center Forcefield target when it is already lit will spot one of the other two targets.

When the saucer is revealed, shooting the drop target or the two side standup targets scores hits on the flying saucer (If the drop target is broken, shooting the hole behind the target will score hits instead). After a certain number of hits, the drop target will remain down, and you can shoot the hole to destroy the saucer. Destroying the saucer saves the country and light that country's lamp permanently.

You can score multiple hits on a single shot; the display will show the number of hits and the total number of damage points scored.

For the first Attack Wave, it takes 4 hits at 50M each to open the saucer, and destroying the saucer scores 200M. On each successive Attack Wave, the number of hits goes up by 4, the value of each hit goes up by 10M, and the bonus for destroying the saucer goes up by 100M. For the fifth Attack Wave, that means 90M per hit, and 20 hits to destroy the saucer for 600M.

An Extra Ball is lit when the second Saucer is defeated. Shoot the Stroke of Luck hole to collect.

Shooting either of the two standups when the saucer is open scores 5M.

If you are in a multi-player game, and you had the saucer hole revealed on your last ball, and on the next ball, the player before you drains with the drop target up, it will remain up for you as well. Hitting it will score 5M like the side targets and reveal the hole (again).

After completing the first five Attack Waves, Conquer Mars is next. Open the Forcefield as before. This time, the drop target will remain down, and you must shoot the hole 10 times to Conquer Mars. Each shot is worth 100M (consistent with the scoring as before), and the final shot conquers Mars and scores 2.5B.

You can only Conquer Mars once per game. For the rest of the game, the drop target will remain up, and hits on the drop target (and not the side standups) will score 100M. The Forcefield will remain down for the rest of the game unless Strobe Multiball is started. The blue Conquer Mars lamp remains lit after Rule the Universe is finished, so you only need to collect the other five awards to start Rule the Universe a second time.


* Multiball : To start regular multiball, you must lock three balls at the lock hole. Depending on the difficulty level of the machine, it will take a certain number of lock ramp shots to open the lock hole. These rules will describe default settings first.

For the first multiball, shoot the lock ramp once to light locks one, two, and three at the hole; the next three shots will go to the hole, with the third starting multiball. After multiball number 1, you must shoot the lock ramp once per lock. The Stroke of Luck award 'Light Lock' will do whatever would have happened if you had actually shot the lock ramp.

Balls aren't actually locked; the same ball is immediately returned to the player and merely a count is made of the number of locks. It isn't possible to steal or lose locked balls.

When ball three is locked, multiball begins. The ball is popped from the lock hole and two more balls are launched into play automatically. Five shots, the four TA shots and the lock ramp, are all lit for jackpots, and each can be collected only once. The first jackpot is worth 60M; the value increases by 10M per jackpot.

As balls are autolaunched, some legitimate shots to the right loop may not score jackpots.

When all five shots have been made, a Super Jackpot is lit at the left loop. Shooting the Super Jackpot scores 250M points and relights all five jackpots again. However, the Super Jackpot moves about every 5 seconds, sweeping across the five shots from left to right, then right to left, etc. Every time it moves you will hear a distinctive 'blip' sound. Once collected, the five Jackpots relight, and it all starts over again. The jackpot value continues to increase by 10M per shot (so after the first Super Jackpot, it is worth 110M) until it maxes at 200M. Play continues in this fashion until down to one ball. The second Super Jackpot per game scores 500M; the third is worth 750M; and then it maxes out at 1B. On some versions of the software, it maxes at 750M and then returns to 250M for the next Super Jackpot.

Once a Super Jackpot is scored, the current jackpot value is held over to the next multiball. Thus, if you only score 1 super jackpot, then at the start of the next multiball, the jackpot will be worth 110M.

If Super Jackpot is lit when multiball ends, it will continue to be lit as a 'Last Chance' for another 10 seconds and continue to move as well. There is a short grace period at the end of the 10 seconds during which the Super Jackpot can still be collected.

Also, there is a very brief period before and after the Super moves that either of the two shots will score the Super Jackpot. In other words, if you shoot the next shot just before it moves, or you shoot the previous shot just after it moves, you will still get the Super Jackpot.

Even more, there is a short grace period at the end of multiball in which you can still collect one, or even two regular jackpots. If you manage to collect your fifth jackpot this way, you still get the 'Last Chance' 10 seconds for a chance at the Super Jackpot.

On default 5-ball play, you must shoot the Lock Ramp to light each Lock separately for each Lock, like the second multiball on 3-ball settings.

You can continue to collect damage points on the Saucer during this and all other multiballs, except Strobe Multiball. After destroying the saucer, however, the Forcefield will raise, and you cannot begin the next Attack Wave until the multiball ends. On newer software revisions, there is a trick to be tried here: it is possible for a second ball to get stuck behind the Forcefield as it is raising. You can attempt this to park a ball out of the way during the multiball. When all other balls drain, a ball search will occur in about fifteen seconds and lower the Forcefield, returning the ball into play. Be careful, though, as it has a tendency to go straight down the middle.

Even better, while the ball is trapped behind the Forcefield, the Saucer drop target remains down (it is reset only when the next Attack Wave is started). If you manage to newton the ball into the saucer hole, by hitting the Forcefield with a second ball, the game will automatically spot the next Attack Wave. This trick only works on newer ROMs, and works during any multiball (although setting it up for Strobe Multiball might be difficult). It is also awarded only once per game per player, spots the Country, and awards the 200M-600M points as usual. Reportedly, this trick can also be used to spot Conquer Mars and earn 2.5B.


* Jet Bumpers : At the beginning of each ball, jet bumpers score 1M each. Each time the bonus multiplier is increased, the jet value increases by 50K for the duration of the ball. +5X bonus increases the value by 250K.

After 100 jet hits, Super Jets is awarded. The jets will score 3M each for the rest of the ball. At the beginning of the next ball, Super Jets will go unlit, and it take 125 hits to get Super Jets again. The third time will take 150, etc.

Super Jets tends to happen naturally over the course of a good game, especially when there are lots of multiballs.

Once Super Jets is active, left and right loops are always held in the Bonus X lanes, and never loop all the way around. This makes it harder to collect Combos, but it does allow you to score lots of points off the jets.

After finishing Rule the Universe, the blue Super Jets lamp will remain lit (on latest ROM levels) if Super Jets is still active, to allow you to start Rule the Universe again on the same ball. In that case, at the end of the ball in which Rule the Universe was started, the Super Jets lamp will be turned off. If Super Jets was started on a different ball, then the lamp is turned off as soon as Rule the Universe ends, and you can start Super Jets again on that same ball.


* Combos : Consecutive ramp/loop shots during single-ball play are counted as Combos. Combos can be scored on any of the ramps, loops, or the lock hole. A 2-Way combo scores 25M, a 3-Way scores 30M, and so on. There is no known maximum. Continuous shots to the same loop are especially satisfying.

If a loop shot stops in the Bonus X lanes, the Combo sequence is stopped. The Combo sequence continues on loop shots only when all 3 TA lamps are complete (the third shot counts, too) and the controlled gate is open to allow the ball to exit the other side of the loop, and when Super Jets is not running.

The combo shots remain lit for a fixed time interval regardless of any other shots made in the interim.

Combos are not available during any multiball unless Martian Multiball is the only multiball running.


* Stroke of Luck : The scoop is lit to award 'Stroke of Luck' at the beginning of the game, and remains lit across balls. Stroke of Luck can be relit by completing the 4 rollover lights in the inlanes and outlanes. Use the flipper buttons to move the lights left and right (each button moves the lights in a different direction), so that balls will roll in an unlit lane, which will then light up. When all four are lit, they all go unlit and Stroke of Luck becomes lit. If Stroke of Luck is already lit, nothing happens; the award is not stackable.

The number of times the rollovers are completed is counted across the game (regardless of how many times you actually collect the Stroke of Luck at the scoop). At 10, an Extra Ball is lit at the scoop. The animation and sound effect for this are easy to miss.

On 5-ball games, the Stroke of Luck EB is lit at 14 instead of 10.

The Stroke of Luck is a pseudo-random award. Possibilities are :

1. 25,000,000 points. Awarded immediately.

2. 50,000,000 points. Ditto.

3. Light Extra Ball. Shoot Stroke of Luck again to collect.

4. Light Lock. For the first multiball, this will light all three locks. After that, it will light one additional lock, regardless if lock is already lit or not.

5. Award Lock. If Lock is already lit, then that lock is awarded and no lock will be lit. Otherwise the next unlit lock is awarded.

6. Multiball. Forget the locks, just start multiball.

7. Lite Martian Attack. Shoot Stroke of Luck again to collect.

8. +5 Bonus X. Same award as regular skill shot.

9. Hold Bonus X. Bonus X will not reset to 1X at the end of this ball.

10. Strobe Multiball. Starts immediately. See below for more details.

11. Video Mode. Starts immediately. See below for more details.

12. Sneak Attack. One of the four martians will begin jumping. Shoot immediately to score 150M; the value counts down quickly. Hitting the martian also awards 2 additional Martian Bombs and lights Martian Attack if it isn't already lit.

13. 1 Martian Bomb. Added to any you already have.

The award is pseudorandom, because sometimes it can be predicted. The third Stroke of Luck award will normally be Strobe Multiball. Stroke of Luck will award Video Mode the first time it is hit after Super Jets has been completed, even if it is the third time. Strobe Multiball will then be the next Stroke of Luck award given.

Stroke of Luck will normally award (regular) Multiball on the last ball of the game if multiball has not yet been started.

Stroke of Luck will normally award 1 Martian Bomb if it is collected during Martian Attack, before Martian Multiball.

Stroke of Luck is not available during any multiball. The award can only be collected from the front entrance to the scoop.

If 'tournament' mode is enabled, then Stroke of Luck always awards 50M and nothing else, in order to de-randomize the games.


* Martian Attack : At the beginning of the game, the seven M-A-R-T-I-A-N targets are all flashing. Completing all seven targets lights the SoL scoop for Martian Attack. The award can be collected from the front or back of the scoop the first time, but then must be collected from the front every other time.

During Martian Attack, all four martians begin jumping up and down, and you must shoot each of the four martians to start Martian Multiball. You can shoot any of the M-A-R targets to kill the lower left martian, and likewise either of the A-N targets to kill the lower right one. You have 30 seconds to kill all four.

Each killed martian is worth 20M, and killing all four starts Martian Multiball. Another ball is launched into play, and the four shots remain lit throughout the multiball for 20M each.

The number of martians killed is counted throughout game. The martians killed during the Attack phase count as well. The game displays the name of the person who has killed the most martians in attract mode.

Everytime the seven targets are completed during regular play, the value of each Martian increases, to 30M, 40M, and finally a max of 50M per Martian. If the targets are completed while Martian Attack is already lit (but not started), then a Martian Bomb is also awarded.

Martian Bombs can also be awarded via Stroke of Luck and Sneak Attack. These are used during the Attack phase only (i.e. not during martian multiball, and they are NOT used during Video Mode either). The launch button will flash when you have at least one martian bomb. Pressing the launch button will then kill one of the remaining flashing martians for you, to help you to complete all four of them. You can do this safely after the ball has gone down an outlane, but not after the ball has landed in the trough. If your fourth martian is killed this way, then Martian Multiball is still started, and two balls are launched back into play.

Martian Bombs are stackable and carry across Martian Attacks. Save bombs that you don't need or that won't help you complete all four for the next Attack. There is no known maximum to the number of Martian Bombs you can collect. The number of total Bombs is displayed each time Martian Bombs are awarded, and it is also available in the Status Report. Unless used, Martian Bombs saved are not worth anything.

If one of the Martian targets is known to be bad, the game will spot that target for you automatically in all circumstances. The 'T' and 'I' targets are likely to go bad at some point, since they take quite a beating.

Total Annihilation shots can be made both during Martian Attack and during Martian Multiball itself. If all 12 TA shots are completed while Martian Multiball is running, Total Annihilation begins immediately, two more balls are launched into play (for a total of four), the usual ball saver for Total Annihilation is started, and both multiballs run concurrently.


* Strobe Multiball : Strobe Multiball is only available as an award from the Stroke of Luck, and can only be played once per game per player. The Forcefield will first raise if it is lowered, all playfield lamps will be turned off, the strobe lamp will begin to flash along with the three Forcefield targets, and two more balls are sent into play. The objective is to hit the Forcefield as many times as possible, until back to one ball.

Each shot scores 50M. On the 10th hit, an Extra Ball is lit. Collecting the Extra Ball will temporarily illuminate the playfield for the Extra Ball lamp effect. On the 20th hit, a 250M bonus is awarded, but without any fanfare or additional lighting. Bonus is also awarded at 30. The display will always tell you the number of total hits, and the next award to be given.

If Martian Attack or Martian Multiball is running during Strobe Multiball, then the Martian targets will be flashing. If a Hurry-Up is active at the start of Strobe Multiball, then the Hurry-Up arrow will flash. If the roaming Super Jackpot is lit, then it will continue to be lit and move until collected or time runs out. These are the only other situations in which other playfield lights can be flashing.

The inlane/outlane rollovers and Bonus X lanes remain active during the round, even though you can't see which ones are lit. You will be able to tell briefly which ones are lit when the playfield is lit for the Extra Ball animation.

There is a lengthy ball saver at the beginning of Strobe Multiball, and a brief ball saver after it ends. If no balls are in play when the game recognizes the end of Strobe Multiball, another ball is launched into play. Basically, your ball cannot end because of Strobe Multiball.


Video Mode : Video Mode is only available as an award from the Stroke of Luck, and it is only given out once per game, per player. The objective is to shoot as many saucers as possible. Your shooter is positioned in the center and fires automatically. Use the left and right buttons to control the direction of the shots. Each saucer hit is worth 3M.

Once, and only once, you may press the launch button to fire a 'Smart Bomb', which will destroy all the saucers on the screen. This has absolutely nothing to do with Martian bombs. Unlike with Martian Bombs, the launch button does not flash to let you know you have a Smart Bomb.

At 30 saucers, a percentaged Extra Ball will descend; shoot it to collect an Extra Ball immediately. If the game has been awarding too many extra balls recently, then it may not appear at all.

At 50 saucers (?), the Mothership will approach. The regular saucers stop landing (any ones that are still descending get zapped as if you have shot them), and the big Mothership starts descending. You must shoot the Mothership before it lands. It is a rather large ship, which zigs and zags quickly to make it more difficult to hit. It takes 80 hits to destroy it; the lower right corner of the display will tell you how many remaining hits are needed. Completing video mode in its entirety is worth a total of 635M points, and displays the message : 'You Have Won; The World Is Safe'.

You can use the Smart Bomb to kill the Mothership as well.

This same video mode is available in the game "Junk Yard", including the Smart Bomb and Mothership features.


* Bonus : At the end of the ball, bonus is awarded. Your bonus consists of some random point value based on how many shots you hit during play, with a base value of 5M, plus 250K for each Martian you've destroyed. This is all then multiplied by your bonus multiplier. It is possible to have very big bonuses, in the billions. The bonus multiplier maxes out at 250X; at that level, each Martian you hit is worth 62.5M.


* Rule the Universe : After completing all 6 major objectives, shoot the SoL scoop to start Rule the Universe. When Rule the Universe becomes lit, Martian Attack and Stroke of Luck become unlit if they were previously lit. Rule the Universe is a 4-ball multiball with about a 30 second ball saver in which nearly all playfield features are lit. Total Annihilation runs, with the base value of each jackpot worth 100M. The saucer drop target scores 100M. The roaming Super Jackpot is lit and scores the same as it does during regular multiball, for an unlimited number of times. Martian Multiball is active, scoring at least 50M per martian. The Annihilation Jackpot is lit at the lock ramp. Super Jets is also active.

If you score 5 billion points, the playfield will go dark, the flippers will be disabled, and the round will end. You just ruled the universe! An extra 5 billion points is awarded, and your initials and the time of election will be displayed in attract mode later on. After a brief animation, a ball will be returned to the plunger lane and you can continue play. You can also go for one of the Skill Shots at this point, too (the regular ballsaver is also active).

Plus, for the rest of the ball after Ruling the Universe, you can collect Victory Laps by shooting any of the five combo shots. The Combo arrows will be solidly lit. Shooting any arrow unlights that arrow and awards a Victory Lap (complete with whooshing sound effect), initially worth 100M. Shooting the saucer drop target relights all five Victory Lap shots (if any are unlit) and increases the value of the shots by 10M each. The saucer target itself scores 100M per hit for the rest of the game. This is an excellent time to start a multiball, especially Total Annihilation.

The Victory Lap value can increase up to 500M. Maximizing Laps is the key to getting a really high score.

If you lose all balls before scoring 5 billion, then nothing else really happens and normal play resumes. This is very depressing.

After RTU multiball, the Conquer Mars lamp remains lit. The Super Jets lamp remains lit for the remainder of the current ball if Super Jets is still active. This allows you to Rule the Universe again on the same ball. With early ROMs, the Super Jets lamp was cleared after RTU which made this impossible, since Super Jets continued to be active on that ball, and couldn't be restarted until the next ball.

If a player rules the universe when he/she is already ruler, then the display will show 'Re-Election #1', and so on until someone else rules the universe, during Attract Mode (it can't know this until the end of a game, when you enter your initials, unless you happen to RTU twice in the same game, in which case it will display 'Re-Election').

If multiple players Rule the Universe in the same game, then only the last player to Rule will get to enter initials. In no way does any scoring affect whether or not you become the new Ruler.


* Concurrent Multiballs : Attack From Mars supports concurrent multiballs to some extent. There are four different multiballs in this game : regular multiball, Martian Multiball, Total Annihilation, and Strobe Multiball (plus Rule the Universe, but that's a totally different beast). Here's how it all fits together :

Regular multiball, Total Annihilation, and Strobe Multiball are all mutually exclusive; only one of these can run at a time. Martian Multiball can run concurrently with any one of them, as long as the two are started in the right order.

In the case of regular multiball or Strobe Multiball, you must start Martian Attack first, and then start the OTHER multiball (once the other multiball is started, you cannot start Martian Attack). Martian Attack continues to run with the same timer, and completing the martians will add Martian Multiball to your current multiball. That means a ball saver will be active for a while. No additional balls are added into play; you must have two for Martian MB, but if you have fewer than two, then you wouldn't be playing another multiball, would you? If your other multiball ends, and you didn't start Martian Multiball, Martian Attack will continue to run as it did before multiball.

In the case of Total Annihilation, you can either start TA first like in the above case, or you can start Martian Multiball first and then start TA, as Total Annihilation shots are awarded during Martian Multiball. In that case, two more balls are added into play to make it a 4-ball multiball, along the normal TA ballsaver.

Concurrent multiballs are lucrative, because with 3 or 4 balls in play, you are likely to hit a lot of the Martian targets without really trying. You will always get more points, though, by concentrating on the major multiball instead (Unless you have a high bonus multiplier, since each martian is worth something in bonus).


* Extra Balls : There are 5 ways to get an Extra Ball in AFM :

1. Complete the second Attack Wave. On 5-ball games, this defaults to the 3rd Attack Wave instead.

2. Complete the inlane/outlane lamps 10 times. For 5-ball, it takes 14 completions of the rollovers.

3. Shoot the EB in Video Mode.

4. Hit the Forcefield 10 times in Strobe Multiball.

5. Via a Stroke of Luck, literally. The randomly lit Extra Ball is usually only lit after a bad first ball, but I have seen it awarded after collecting three Extra Balls and Ruling the Universe.

Extra balls are all lit at the Stroke of Luck hole, except for the Video Mode EB which is awarded immediately. Each of these can only be collected once per game.

Extra balls are the only awards that can be collected at the scoop even during any multiball. Normally only front shots to the scoop will award the EB, but during multiball, you can collect it from the front or back, since the game can't always tell which direction you shot it from with absolute certainty. So it just gives it to you either way. This works with any legitimate multiball but not when you have two balls in normal play because of a missing pinball suddenly appearing on the playfield. In that case, you may get cheated out of an extra ball shot from the front legitimately.

The game seems to detect back shots into Stroke of Luck based on jet bumper hits and rollovers. All other shots are considered front shots. Thus, it is possible for a ball to 'air' over the hole, not touch a jet bumper, fall into the back of the hole, and award a front Stroke of Luck shot.

Attack from Mars also supports the Buy-In feature at the end of the game. Unlike many previous games, there is no separate Buy-In button; the Start button will buy an extra ball for 1 credit. So don't press Start to abort the 7 sec. buy-in countdown -- use the flippers or launch button (or off switch) instead. Depending on the settings of your machine, buy-in may be disabled completely, or there may be a fixed or unlimited number of times you can buy-in. Buy-in can also be enabled for 1/2 credit. There is an extra long ballsaver at the beginning of every ball bought-in, but once used, it is gone. There is nothing else special about the buy-in ball.


* Replays and High Scores : The replay value will fluctuate widely among different machines, but it is most definitely going to be in the several billion range, at least. After collecting a replay, the replay value will grow by 50% of its original, base value, until more coins are inserted (not counting buy-ins).

There are 2 high score lists, one for no buyins and one for buyins. The Grand Champion is also maintained, which is the highest score attained regardless of buyins. The game also keeps track of the person who destroyed the most martians, and the last person to Rule the Universe. For the Ruler, it displays the date and time of the ruling, and the re-election count for that player, in addition to his/her initials.


* Software Compensation : There is no compensation for a broken loop or ramp switch. This is most frustrating, as you won't be able to start Total Annihilation, collect a Super Jackpot, and of course, Rule the Universe.

If you try for a Super Skill Shot but the ball falls into the lit Bonus X lane, you will be awarded the Super Skill Shot of 50M and the Saucer will open, as if you had hit the Forcefield.

If the drop target becomes stuck down, you will not be able to score Saucer hits for a while (you can still score hits from the two side standups). After so many shots to the saucer hole, the game will flag the drop target as bad, and the hole will spot 1 drop target hit. Once the drop target switch becomes active again, though, the compensation is turned off, so an intermittent target is worse than a totally hosed target.

A bad Stroke of Luck kicker is bad news. If only the SoL switch is stuck open or closed (but not intermittent), then there is some compensation for balls that fall in from the back. If a ball trips one of the Bonus X lanes, and no jet bumpers or the right loop switch isn't triggered in about 3 seconds, the game assumes the ball fell into the SoL hole, and since there is no way to detect front shots, it awards a front SoL shot, then kicks out the ball.

If the Forcefield 3-bank won't go down, hitting any of the three targets will spot hits to the saucer drop target/hole.

If the right ramp entrance gate switch and the lock ramp gate switch are bad, then shooting the Lock ramp will count as both a Lock ramp and a right ramp shot (the game cannot tell the difference between the two, so it awards both). There is probably a software bug here, though : sometimes in this state, Lock will be lit but the divertor will not open, so that you cannot collect the lock until the next ball, when everything is reset.

Released in October 1981.


This was the first pin table to feature the revolutionary lower-reversed playing surface. However, its biggest claim to fame is that it was the first accepted table to cost 50 US cents to play, which quickly made it the highest earning pin game in the history of the industry.


8,774 units were produced.


The original concept for Black Hole did NOT originate at Gottlieb! Black Hole was designed and built by two pinball novices from Harrisburg, PA and presented in a working concept prototype to Gottlieb.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


To succeed at Black Hole, you'll need to learn how to maximize your points on the lower surface, which you get to through the gravity tunnel. By clearing all the letters 'B-L-A-C-K' in sequence, you activate a g-force accelerator. The flashing arrow shows which letter you need to get next. One g-force accelerator doubles the points you earn. Clearing the letters 'H-O-L-E' in sequence also earns a g-force accelerator. When both g-force accelerators are lit you earn triple points as well as lighting a special. Clearing the bank of three drop-targets below advance the roll-under lit specials. Complete all three rollovers up top to advance the bonus multiplier from 2x up to 5x.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1980.


Black Knight introduced 'Magna-Save' and the Bonus Ball concept where the player with the highest score won additional seconds of free play. BK was also the first game ever that had a split level or 'two level' playfield. Magna-Save was a feature where a user could press a button on either side and magnets would prevent the ball from draining via that outlane. It would stop and hold the ball and drop it into the inlane. The user had to perform some task to re-enable Magna-Save.


Comments from the designer : Black Knight was the first game ever to employ faceted inserts (the transparent inlaid plastic windows) in the playfield. My design was a simple eight-sided 'Jewel Look', but insert texturing progressed from there to many different designs, finally settling on refracting radial lines originating at the center of round and rectangular inserts and from points of arrows and lightning bolts, etc.


13,075 units were produced.


A Black Knight unit appears in the 1987 movie, 'Superman IV - The Quest for Peace'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Multiball : Multiball play on Black Knight involves 2 or 3 balls. Balls are locked on the upper playfield, behind the left drop target bank. Balls are released for Multiball play by locking three balls on upper playfield, or by locking one or two balls on upper playfield, and another ball in the kickout hole on the lower playfield (behind the right drop target bank).

There is no time limit for locking balls for Multiball play. The game can be adjusted to allow lit 'LOCK' lights to remain lit from ball to ball, or will reset with each new ball played (default). The latter is the more difficult setting, and requires the player to lock 2 or 3 balls on the upper playfield during the course of one ball-in-play, in order to achieve Multiball play. See the game's adjustments in the Instruction Booklet for more details.

During Multiball, all scoring is multiplied by the number of balls on the playfield (2X, or 3X).


* Drop Targets : There are 2 banks of drop targets on each playfield level. Targets on the left side of the playfield are denoted by blue lights in front of them, and targets on the right side are denoted by orange lights.

The drop target banks are timed, so after hitting one or more targets in a bank, you have only a limited amount of time to hit the rest of the targets in that bank, before the bank is reset.

Completing a bank of drop targets activates a Magna-Save on the lower playfield, if one or both are not lit (See Magna-Save below).

Completing a bank of drop targets also lights one of the three arrow lights in front of the bank. Completing each bank of drop targets on either playfield level three times each, lights the Extra Ball on the upper playfield (see Extra Ball below).

The amount of time allowed to the player to complete a bank of drop targets before they reset, is adjustable. See the Instruction Manual for more information.


* Extra Ball : There are 2 possible ways to achieve an Extra Ball : one on the upper playfield, and one on the lower.

To light the first Extra Ball light (upper playfield), the player must complete the upper or lower playfield drop target banks three time each. Then shoot the ball through the left ramp u-turn on the upper playfield to score the Extra Ball.

The second Extra Ball is lit by completing all four drop target banks (upper and lower playfields) three times each. This lights the Extra Ball in the turn-around on the lower playfield.

One arrow in front of a drop target bank is lit each time the bank is completed.


* Mystery Score : When the ball goes through the left flipper return lane (which may be assisted by Magna-Save), the center ramp is lit for a short time for Mystery Score. The Mystery Score is awarded upon completion of the center ramp when lit, and awards a random value of 20,000 to 99,000 points (Contrary to today's hyper-inflated-score games, this is a significant award).


* Spinner : When the ball goes through the right flipper return lane (which may also be assisted by Magna-Save), the spinner is lit for a short time for 5,000 points per spin. A well-placed shot through the spinner can award as much as 100,000 points!


* Bonus Multipliers : The turn-around on the lower playfield awards bonus multipliers. When all bonus multipliers have been attained (2X, 3X, 4X, 5X), and bonus value is at maximum, the bonus lights in the 'sword' on the lower playfield will animate and 'scroll'. The bell will ring each time additional bonus-awarding targets are made after this point (flipper return lanes, outlanes, and drop target bank completion).


* Magna-Save : Magna-Save features are activated by completing a bank of three drop targets. The right Magna-Save will always become activated before the left. Pressing the red button above the white flipper button will activate the Magna-Save feature for the corresponding side of the playfield. The Magna-Save feature is used to attempt to 'grab' the ball, and drop it down the flipper return lane, to allow it to continue in play. Magna-Save features must be re-activated after being used by completing a drop target bank again.

The amount of time that the Magna-Save feature is on, when activated by the player, is adjustable. See game adjustments in the Instruction Manual.


* Bonus Ball : If 2 or more players are in the game, the player with the higher score at the end of the game gets a 30 second Bonus Ball (this feature, and it's time limit are adjustable- see Instruction Manual). 'Bonus Ball' is actually an unlimited number of balls available to the player, but only for the 30-second period. So you can lose the ball as often as you wish during Bonus Ball, and it will be replenished, until the 30 seconds has expired.

The goal during Bonus Ball is to complete all 4 drop target banks in the 30-second Bonus Ball time, in order to light the turn-around for Special. The turn-around must be completed to obtain the Special.


* Strategies :

1. Go for the Extra Ball. It is easiest to complete the drop target banks on the upper playfield to light the first Extra Ball (upper playfield). And drop targets can be completed much faster during Multiball.

2. If center ramp is lit for Mystery Score, and you miss the shot from the lower left flipper, but manage to get the ball up to the upper playfield anyway, allow it to drain back down the center ramp, if possible. This will award the Mystery Score if you can do it before the Mystery Score light goes out.

3. During Multiball, focus your concentration on the playfield level that has the most balls on it. That is, if more balls (2 or more) are in play on the upper playfield, focus your attention on the flippers there. Or if more balls are on the lower playfield, focus your attention there. The playfield with more balls on it will be the source of more scored points during Multiball.

4. During Multiball, concentrate on making the Mystery Score and Spinner shots when lit, as described above. This is where the big points come in, especially with the Multiball playfield score multipliers lit.

5. Biggest points are awarded during Multiball. To get bigger scores, focus on locking balls for Multiball play, and on personal strategies and skills for keeping balls in play longer during Multiball.

- TRIVIA -


This game was the first game to implement two features that would become common in modern pinballs : the 'Hurry Up' mode, and the 'Wizard Mode' (a special high scoring mode).


Approximately 5,700 units were produced.


Game has two different plastic artwork versions for the upper play-field : 'futuristic-style' and 'stone castle-style'. These differing plastics appear around the lock assembly, near the 'W.A.R' lanes, as the upper ramp cover, and as the 'Magna-save ready' sign. Reportedly, the futuristic artwork may be the earlier design.


- SCORING -


UPPER PLAYFIELD


* W-I-N Lanes : Increases the bonus multiplier and lights 'Ransom' at the drawbridge.


* W-A-R Lanes : Starts 'Hurry Up' (countdown timer) when completed; shoot the ball up the Skyway ramp to collect it. Also, during Double Knights Challenge, scores a million points if completed.


* Drawbridge : Hit the three-bank stand-ups to lower the drawbridge, and then shoot the ball up the bridge to lock a ball. If the 'Ransom' light is lit, shoot the ball up the bridge to spot a letter for 'RANSOM' (shown on the backglass). Also collects the Jackpot during multiball.


* Upper Loop : Shoot the ball around the loop to increase the loop bonus; consecutive shots earn different awards (extra ball, hold bonus, etc.).




LOWER PLAYFIELD


* Skyway Ramp : Scores the 'Hurry Up' and the Skyway Bonus, as well as an Extra Ball, if any of them is lit.


* K-N-I-G-H-T Targets : If all the targets are hit within a set amount of time, a letter in B-L-A-C-K is spotted and the kickback and the Magna-Save is re-lit. Lighting all the letters in B-L-A-C-K lights the 1 million-point Skyway Bonus (which is collected at the ramp).


* U-Turn Loop : Scores 25,000 points for the first loop, and increases for each consecutive loop, maxing out at 250,000 points. Also lights the Challenge Lane for 'Double Knights Challenge'.


* Lightning Lane : Spins the Lightning Wheel for a random award (when lit); the ball is kicked to the upper playfield.


* Challenge Lane : When lit, it starts the two-ball 'Double Knights Challenge', in which completing the W-A-R Lanes score 1 million points, and lasts until you lose one ball.


* Magna-Save : Prevents right outlane drains; activated with a separate button.




SPECIAL SCORING MODES


* Multiball : After locking the third ball in the Drawbridge, Multiball starts. During this mode, hitting the K-N-I-G-H-T targets increases the Jackpot. Shooting a ball in the Drawbridge awards the Jackpot. If you lose two balls, a countdown begins to lock the remaining ball in the Drawbridge to collect the Jackpot.


* The King's Ransom : The game's 'Wizard Mode'. It starts after all six letters of R-A-N-S-O-M is collected (as shown on the backglass). In this mode, EVERYTHING is lit for a limited amount of time : Unlimited balls, 3-ball Multiball, the Bonus Multiplier is maxed out and held, Jackpot is lit at the drawbridge, 'Double Knights Challenge' is lit, Extra Ball and Skyway Bonus are lit at the ramp, and the U-Turn Loops are maxed out at 250,000 points!


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The simplest strategy for BK2K can be summed up in 4 words : avoid the lower playfield. Most of the big points are on the upper playfield, and while the ball is on the upper playfield, you can't lose it!


The most important shot to learn is the Skyway. You should practice it to the point where you can nearly always one-touch a ball draining off the upper playfield right back up into the Skyway off the right flipper, preferably without trapping it first. This one shot will make your score skyrocket, since it prevents draining and sets you up for big points from Hurry-Up and extra balls galore from the Loop.


On the upper playfield, learn to make Loop shots; they're the key to extra balls, and with practice you can also learn to drop the ball into the WIN lanes to light Ransom. When Hurry-Up or Extra Ball lights on the Skyway, don't be afraid to let the ball drain to the lower playfield to collect it; once you've practiced the Skyway shot sufficiently, the reward is well worth the minor risk.  Also, it's vital to learn the art of nudging the ball around the WAR lanes; a good player can nearly always make the ball dribble its way across the tops of the lanes to the upper flipper, keeping it on the upper playfield, and probably getting credit for at least one of the lanes in the process, even on a machine with pretty tight tilt settings.


During Multiballs, you pretty well have no choice but to learn to deal with the lower playfield. The Challenge Lane will hold onto a ball going into it for about ten seconds before letting it go, which is a good way of getting a ball out of the way. Also, don't forget the Lightning Lane; even if it's not lit, it still gets the ball back to the upper playfield. Multiballs are also a good time to shoot for the KNIGHT targets, if you need to relight the Kickback or Magna-Save; with all the balls bouncing around, you'll hit your share of drop targets anyway. It's recommended to NOT shooting at the drop targets unless you need to relight something; every time you clear them, the timer accelerates, so it gets that much harder to clear them when you actually need them. And the

bonus for completing BLACK is pretty paltry; you can get much greater rewards by concentrating on the upper playfield and making your Hurry-Ups.


During King's Ransom, concentrate on making the Skyway and Drawbridge shots at least once each, since that's where the big points are. Don't mess up your shots with the balls already on the playfield just to plunge a new ball in (unless you're going to use the new ball to shoot for the Jackpot); in particular, if a ball pops into the plunger lane with less than 5 seconds left in King's Ransom, and you're confident that you're not going to lose one of the balls in play in the next few seconds, leave it there! It's effectively an extra ball; when King's Ransom ends, just leave the other ball in the plunger lane, and plunge it out when you finally lose the last ball in play.

The basic idea of this pinball is to sink ships. The game features a rotating cannon situated underneath the playfield used to aim the ball at targets to award letters in the word SINK SHIP. During multiball you also get letters for shooting flashing ramps. Once SINK SHIP is spelled, you load the cannon to light the center shot (the 'Broadside') to get big points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


During the game, a close-up of Dracula's eyes appears on the display at random intervals. When his eyes are crossed (typically during idle periods early in a game), press the START button for a picture of Fluffy the Vampire (he looks suspiciously like one of the Doctors from Dr. Who!) and 20 points. This may or may not work if you have credits in the machine (the Start button may start another game instead).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


All of the secret awards which involve flipping at some point or another can generally be obtained by holding both flippers up at the appropriate moment. Flipping vigorously may or may not work. Doing this at several points in the game will lead to Secret Awards, which probably aren't worth many (or any) points, but are extremely amusing and tend to impress crowds even long after you've grown tired of them.


Holding the flippers as the Snackbar opens awards 'NO MORE BAD FOOD' and blows up the Snackbar. It is rumoured that this tends to make the awards from the Snackbar more pleasant (less likely to be food). Note that you have to hold the flippers before the lights come on in the animation and the sign says OPEN.


Holding the flippers as the Snackbar attendant gives you a menu item will earn the quote 'Come here, punk', while a hand reaches out and chokes the attendant, labeled 'Choking Fatality'. This choking goes on for quite a while after the animation ends - listen closely.


Flipping at the end of Video Mode, when your opponent is dazed and the display says KNOCKOUT, will knock his head completely from his body (which is rather gruesome), and is labeled 'FATALITY'. 'There's more where that came from!'.


A ball which goes around the Back Orbit of the game when it has not been shot from the plunger awards the Sneak-In Bonus, which is 1M the first time, 2M the second, and so on. A very fast shot up the Center Shot is the best way to try to get this. It's easy on some machines. The ball then comes screaming down the Left Saucer Lane. Unfortunately, it's usually preferable to have the ball stay in the P-A-I-D Lanes instead.


When you reach 35M in Super Creature Feature, the game stops awarding points, and the display says DON'T BE GREEDY. Presumably this is to stop 'Diner'-style play from keeping the ball going in the Whirlpool forever. It's actually quite hilarious.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1994. 7,019 units were produced. This game was part of WMS' SuperPin series.


Based on the 1993 movie, starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes; Stallone and Snipes provide custom speech for this game. 


Doug Watson had serious difficulty creating the backglass because the movie production team kept rejecting his designs. He eventually discovered that the rejections were coming from Wesley Snipes, who wanted to ensure he did not look like a crazed character on the backglass because he was concerned about his upcoming career in Hollywood. Because of this, the final backglass is much simpler than early designs, and all 3 characters were given 'mathematically equal' backglass coverage, with 'handsome' features.


The 8th AcMag award is an exploding cow.


A cow can be seen on the rotating icon panel for the top lock's mystery award.


When you enable any multiball there's a DO on the bottom left of the display and a HO on the bottom right.


When you shoot the Fortress multiball there's a DOHO in the display (on the right side in the hill).


- UPDATES -


Version L-1 (Changes from revision P-5)

Date : April 19, 1994

- Initial release to production.

- Fixed an error in status report that made it show the wrong number of combos to get an extra ball.

- Fixed the lamp labels for the M and L rollovers.

- Added a few more German translations.

- Added code to compensate for the gun triggers getting stuck ON.

- Enhanced the Combos a bit.

- Changed a bunch of score values

- Added a bunch of effects : sound, display, lights.

- Fixed the 5-ball multiball audit.  It was not chalking.

- Added an (adjustable) extra ball on the Retina Scan. If it's adjusted off, an Explode Hurry-up is put in its place.

- Fixed the broken claw or diverter awards so a super jackpot is possible during multiball when the claw is broken.

- Put a 'minor' car chase award on the left and right ramps. Hitting the car crash lights the lamps solid. Shooting a ramp with the light on solid gives the current car crash value.

- The game will now complain at power up if none of the trough optos are working.

- Once per game, we will ball save on the left outlane if the ball bounces out after the eject kicks.

- Made the ramps which feed the left or right return lanes do the Access Claw and Light Quick Freeze work. This is in case the rollovers are broken, or in case the ball doesn't drop correctly from the ramps.

- Added an adjustment for secret features. The default setting is ON. The secret features can be turned off only if tournament mode is ON.

- Added Demolition Jackpot. It is lit at the end of the fourth multiball for the rest of the ball. Shooting the cryoprison awards a bunch of points for each jackpot shot in each of the multiballs.


Version L-2

Date : May 6, 1994

- Added a bunch of effects : sound, display, lights.

- Added a French AIDS message (French jumpers and Language only).                   

- Added the rest of the German and French translations.    

- Fixed 2 errors in status report. It was showing the incorrect value for jackpot when multiball was ready, and it was showing only the super jackpot value when in multiball.                                            

- Changed the stuck handle switch stuff so it checks for bad switches after it puts one back in service. And made the claw work correctly when handle switches are bad.                                                 

- Changed the default replay boost to 75M. 100M for export games. Also boosted up the default replay values.                  - Changed the logic on the car crash ball saver to make it immune to players shaking the game to activate it.

- Fixed the combo accounting.  The graffiti bomb was giving 2 combos for the 'add combo' award.

- Fixed the computer award 'collect bonus'. It was not including the 'trigger combo' portion of bonus.


Version L-3

Date : May 11, 1994

- Added a US AIDS awareness message to attract mode.		 

- Fixed the Retina Scan maximum value. It would jump from 30M to 48M on the jet bumpers. It now correctly maxxes out at 35M. Made it harder to jiggle the game during the 3rd multiball wave to make the cars move and boost jackpots (And turn on ball saver).

- Added an adjustment to turn off the speech in match.

- Added an adjustment for the car crash ball saver. CRASH BALL SAVE can be set to EASY (default) to turn on the ball save with the 2nd opto, or to HARD to turn on the ball save with the standup target.	 

- Made the claw smarter about the coin door interlock switch disabling the magnet. When the coin door is closed, the game checks to see if it thinks the magnet is broken, and if so, tries to check it again.


Version L-4

Date : May 20, 1994

- Added French translations for the adjustments added in L-2 and L-3.

- The phrase 'Enhance your calm' was removed from the L-2 sound ROM. Sound test was still trying to use it. Another phrase has been substituted.

Zone (lit) : 40K


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Master the fault trip. This is by far the most important shot of the game. Use it to accumulate miles, spot the more difficult zones (zone 6 and zone 9), and receive the Million and Jackpot scores.


* Pound the miles. This leads to extra balls and basically boosts up your score. This especially true after 99 miles, when each center ramp shot is worth 200K points and the bonus is worth up to 594K points. Work on consecutive center ramp shots to accumulate the miles faster.


* After hitting the shelter twice, the Captive Ball will stay lit at 100K. It then takes only two consecutive center ramp shots to light the 250K shot. If you feel like gambling (it's a sucker shot), go for the Captive Ball to enable Quick Multiball. Usually it's worth the gamble, since it can lead to the M-M-M-Million shot.


* On Quick Multiball, don't shoot the ball too hard to cause it to cause the ball to "overpass" into the center ramp. This puts the ball on the lower left flipper at just about the same time the second ball gets ejected past the upper left flipper, which ruins your initial chance at the Million shot.


* If possible, shoot the ball into the "overpass" when starting Multiball (except for the Quick Multiball). This gives a good shot at the center ramp to enable the Jackpot before the other balls get in the way.


* It's almost always a good idea to shoot for the eject hole (zone 5) from the right flipper. This will eject the ball so that it rolls slowly past the upper left flipper for an attempt at the fault.

905 units were produced. This was the last pin produced by Mylstar and production was continued by Premier Technology. It is also the last game designed by Ed Krynski for Gottlieb/Mylstar.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The classic gameplay is based on hitting lit targets and clearing banks. You score big points by building up to the maximum bonus. Normally, your bonus progression is reset between balls. By clearing all ten drop-targets up top with one ball, your bonus progression is not reset when you lose a ball. You add to your bonus by hitting the lit target up top, down below, or advance two by rolling over the lit monkey. Each time you hit the targets, the lit targets and the monkey move.

Elvira is known to be a little risque. As a precautionary measure, Elivra games were shipped with a small, black lingerie 'decal', to be placed over ELVIRA's plunging cleavage on the backglass. The software included a similar option to tone down the quotes. This was the 'Rated-G' option, intended to 'Protect the eyes and ears of the little Party Monsters'.


The slingshot/outlane plastics are bordered by long bones. The 'broken' bones on these plastics are an 'inside joke' about Dennis Nordman's motorcycle accident, which occurred during the development of Elvira. In fact, Dennis Nordman broke many, many bones in the accident and basically designed Elvira from a hospital bed!


The graphic on the right side of the game near the pizza passage with the monster carrying a shitload of pizza boxes. One of the pizza boxes is named 'Pinball Pete's', and this is the name of the Arcade that Tim Arnold used to own (and subsequently sold to his brother) in Michigan. Guess someone working on the game wanted to point out Tim and his efforts in pinball.


Famed pinball designer Steve Ritchie provided assistance for this game after original designer Dennis Nordman sustained severe injuries in a motorcycle accident. Thus, the 'broken' bones on the plastics are an 'inside joke' about Nordman's motorcycle accident, which occurred during the development of Elvira.

This game has two 7-digit alphanumeric score displays and two 7-digit numeric-only score displays.


- TRIVIA -


F-14 had a first-ever kickback device that fired the ball straight back at the flippers at very high speed, called the Jagov Kicker. F-14 was the first game with 'Autosave', which meant the player could have the ball back if it drained prematurely (at the start of a ball), was shot down between the flippers by the Jagov Kicker, or drained during the onset of multiball, etc...


14,502 units were produced.


There were 10 prototype games made. The cabinet art design was deemed too plain and was changed for production. The clear flash lamp domes along the back wall of the playfield were too blinding during play, and all were changed to a red color. The beacons on top of the backbox also were too bright and so their domes were changed.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Before you plunge the ball into play, hit a flipper button several times. This makes some of the flashers flash and explosions are heard (This can be done at the start of each ball).

This addictive table was designed with well thought-out objectives and features five flippers. Two flippers in the upper left corner create a mini playfield.


- TECHNICAL -


Gottlieb System 1

Model Number : 435


- TRIVIA -


Considered by many to be the best wide-body table of its era and possibly of all-time, and a true Gottlieb classic.


6,800 units were produced.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Genie is all about building up and scoring a huge bonus. Firs, you need to concentrate on getting the bonus up to 20,000. Completing the red drop-targets lights the Special target, resets the red and white drop targets, scores 10,000 points, and lights the white drop targets for increased scoring. Not only does this mean you'll be getting a nice size bonus, but you'll also activate the ball trap. When the ball trap is active, you can receive the full bonus before you lose a ball. There are many areas that add to your bonus. Such as the rollovers, as well as the targets and even the spinner - all add to your bonus when lit.

Goin' Nuts (c) 1983 Gottlieb.


- TECHNICAL -


Model Number : 682


- TRIVIA -


This table never actually made it into production as new management considered wider tables too expensive to mass produce. Only 10 units were made as engineering samples. The unique style of timer based gameplay and the rarity of this table make it a classic collector's item today.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Goin' Nuts is an unique table offering timer based gameplay. When the game begins, three balls, called squirrels, are launched automatically. Each nut target you hit adds 3 seconds to the timer. Your squirrels are collecting nuts. When you lose a squirrel, the remaining two earn two seconds for any nut you hit. Simply put, when you have two or three squirrels running around, collect nuts ans build up that timer. When you only have one squirrel left, your strategy has to change. The objective is to re-launch a multi-squirrel mode before the timer which you have accumulated counts down to zero. Multi-squirrel modes can be re-launched several different ways. When lit, scoring a rollover will re-launch two squirrel mode.

- TRIVIA -


This game was intended to emulate the success of Gottlieb's "Silver Slugger" which was a low-cost game with earnings that rivaled expensive Williams/Bally games like "Diner". Hence it has virtually no ramps, toys, or backbox animation.


The original title was "Poker Night" with a theme centering around a congregation of poker-playing, pizza-eating men. Reportedly, one target was required to 'answer the phone'.

Date : 04-Apr-2001

- Fix for French multiball ballsaver exploit issue.

- Fixed problem where bonus wouldn't count total chips above 255 correctly.


Software Release : 3.00

Date : 03-Dec-2001

- Game plays and feels a lot faster now thanks to all this.

- Switch scanning rewritten. Matrix still scanned 2 cols/ms, but all debouncing is done by exec now.

- Fixed switches not dispatching if they closed and opened before exec had a chance to process them.

- Sound system bugs, particularly related to followup %age, fixed.

- Added statistical analysis of switch closures, which allows detection of both hyper- and hyposensitive switches. It also allows software compensation for broken switches, based on legal opinion.

- Reorganized adjustments and resets. Adjustments that weren't really adjustments are gone now, with the exception of custom message and the pricing editor.

- Added Portals 'Installs' menu, which will affect a number of adjustments without needing to reset audits.

- Duty-cycling for all coils implemented. Duty updated every 2ms with resolution as low as 1/16.

- Fixed an ancient Roll'n'Win LEFF bug that would scrawl.

- Added grace-grace periods for multiballs.

- Retimed a bunch of events with the newer faster system.

- Finally did Instant Info.

- Added coindoor ballsaver feature and adjustment. Currently, the game must be on free play for this adjustment to work, but this will likely change in the future. This adjustment, when enabled, will ballsave any balls that are currently in-play for 2 seconds per ball, UNLESS the ball save timer is already longer than that (in which case the timer is unchanged) when the coin door is opened. Balls are then relaunched when the coin door is closed again. If the game is in Tournament Mode, then this behavior will ALWAYS occur, regardless of the setting of this adjustment and the free play adjustment.

- Added adjustment for flipper button ball launching. This is intended primarily for disabled people; valid settings are LEFT FLIPPER, RIGHT FLIPPER, EITHER FLIPPER, BOTH FLIPPERS, DISABLED (default). It specifies which flipper button(s) will autolaunch the ball when the game is waiting for the player to plunge the ball.

- Added non-valid-playfield ball search.

- Now check the shooter groove when playfield goes valid, and fire kicker if ball is there.

- Added game start ball search, though it is probably pretty rare that it will actually occur because powerup ball search and in-game ball search both correct the current balls-installed count.

- Added total pages for every multiball and super mode.

- Flipper button debouncing and dispatching totally rewritten.

- Fixed replay level adjustment display bug.

- Added tech alert alerts to coin door open and powerup.

- Fixed changing replay award type turning off match.

- Revamped powerup ball search.

- Added display effect for powerup ball search and for in-game ball search starting with ball search #2.

- Added slot machine hurryup award display effect.

- Added director's cut display effect for attract mode.

- Retimed attract mode effects so they don't go away now.

- Retimed many events and their grace periods, and added grace-grace periods to same.

- Retimed ball search.

- Fixed flipper hold-power fire if held when they were inactive.

- Fixed game start speech calls.

- Improved flipper choice time wait.

- Probably some other stuff too.

Main CPU : M6808 (@ 1 MHz)

Sound CPU : M6809 (@ 2 MHz), M6808 (@ 1 MHz)

- TRIVIA -


This game was based on designer Steve Ritchie's real-life high-speed (146 mph) chase from the police in his 1979 Porsche 928.


During its design, it was joking referred to as 'High Cost' by some rival Williams designers, due to the production cost for this game at the time it was made.


High Speed was the first pinball to play a complete song, and also :

The first Williams pinball game to use alpha-numeric displays.

The first diverter in a pinball.

The first 'Kick-Big' (kicker and scoop) in a pinball.

The first use of Auto Percentaging (for replay scores).

The first 'Jackpot' in a pinball, during multi-ball and the first 'Jackpot' that carried over between games.


17,080 units were produced.

In the Attract mode, press the Extra Ball button when the display shows 'In memory of Joe Joos jr.'


Tapp the Extra Ball button while starting : 

1) Pinbot Poker to make Pinbot pull out an ace of clubs from his sleeve. 

2) Keno to get Pinbot to make all 25 squares match for 99,000,00. 

3) Slot machine to get Pinbot to change reels to 'Light Extra Ball'. 

4) Roll the Dice to get Pinbot to flip the dice to 12 x Dice Bonus. 

5) Casino Run to hear a cow moo, and now each shot to 'spin the reels' during Casino Run changes the first bomb into another award (only works once per Casino Run). 

6) End of Ball Bonus (with 2x to 5x) to get an extra bonus multiplier. 

These cheats are not sure to work all the time, but when they do you'll hear Pinbot saying : 'Look over there', 'Look Hally's Comet', or 'Look there's Rudy'.

- TRIVIA -


Mata Hari was produced in both EM (170 units produced) and SS (16,260 units produced) versions.


The back-glass shows a dagger; there's a version with an inscription on that dagger reading 'Meine Ehre HeiBt Treue' (translates from German as 'My honor is loyalty'). This inscription was the motto of the Waffen SS troops in WWII and was adapted from a statement made by Hitler in 1931. Mata Hari died during WWI rendering the inscription an anachronism for this game.


Margaretha Zelle (1876-1917) was born in the Netherlands and established herself as a successful exotic dancer, traveling all over Europe under the name Mata Hari. During WWI she consorted with high-ranking officers, both German and French, which ultimately led to her being executed as a spy.

One of the items you can shoot with the catapult is a cow.

A cow is seen on the backglass.

The peasants says that the King has taken their cows.


Default initials for Grand Champion and Multiball Madness Champ is MOO.




Shooting ramps consecutively will make Skull from No Fear appear. No fear is also one of the catapult attacks. 


Sir Psycho declares 'Again!' (from "No Fear") randomly during castle demolition.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Enter the initials MOO in the High Score list to hear cows mooing.


* Shooting ramps consecutively will make Skull from "No Fear - Dangerous Sports" appear. No Fear is also one of the catapult attacks.


* "Mortal Kombat" lines : shoot the right ramp two times in a row for 'Toasty!', three times for 'Fatality'. Sometimes 'I challenge you!' is heard.


* Push Fire button during video mode to clear the screen of birds.


* Catapult 3 cows. The next time you get the video mode (and this will probably be the second video mode, activated after say 40 or 50 FIRE's) it will be save the calves, where the children are replaced by calves.

- UPDATES -


Version 1.0 (Changes since prototype 0.5)

Date : August 16, 1998

- Added the instrument bonus rule.

- Monster bash and monsters of rock scoring changed.

- Fixed a bug with the setup for the concert halls for each player. In multi-player games, only the player who played last would have the concert halls that they had earned. All other players would have no halls. This has been corrected.

- Last chance rule added for Frankenstein (when Frank multiball ends and the player has not collected the keyboard).

- Flipper speedup now available for most ball-holding display shows.

- Added the Lyman's Lament rule.


Version 1.06

- Addition : An audit for starting the Frankenstein 'last chance' feature has now been added. 

- Addition : A high score for mosh pit multiball has now been added. 

- Addition : Some new sounds and speech have been added. 

- Addition : Some artwork has been added to the Monster Bash and Monsters of Rock display awards. 

- Bug fix : When the random award would give out a silver bullet, the full moon fever grace period would not allow the random award to complete. This has now been fixed. 

- Bug fix : Some messages were not being displayed correctly in the custom message- this has now been fixed. 

- Bug fix : A typo in the spelling of the adjustment for auto-flip disable has been corrected. 

- Bug fix : Multiball total display effects. Occasionally a multiball total display effect might run more than once for the same multiball. This has now been fixed. 

- Bug fix : Some problems with some of the presets for the 'install' features have been fixed. "Install medium" and default settings are now the same, as originally intended. 

- Bug fix : Last chance feature with Frankenstein running with flaming torch was not blinking the lamp for the launch button. This has now been fixed. 

- Bug fix : During the Lyman's Lament cheat, if the player earns the feature again, the player will now be credited with the points for the award. 

- Bug fix : The way the mosh pit multiball total was being displayed has now been fixed. 

- Change : The long period of silence between game end and high score/match being displayed has been shortened. 

- Change : The Tomb Treasure target will now award 2 bumper hits toward lighting the Mummy Mayhem mode (when multiball is not active). 

- Change : Frankenstein table and up/down bank motors will now not be activated if a switch is shorted out. Test report will now detect and report if a row is shorted, so the switch compensation mode will take over. 

- Change : Auto-flip can now be moved by lane-change if only 1 lane works. (In this case, the light will toggle with the flipper). 

- Change : Lock post on the right ramp has been enhanced to stay up longer at the start of Frankenstein mutliball mode, and for Frankenstein 'last chance', to compensate for a Frankenstein table motor that might be running slower than normal. 

- Change : The French preset to include maximum stacked extra balls has now been changed to 1 (adjustment A.1 03).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


With a game started, press the following sequence : B, 11L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 6L, 1R.

If entered successfully Lyman Sheats will say 'Totally' and your next award at the 'venue' scoop will be 'Lyman's Lament'.

- UPDATES -


REVISION 0.8

Date: April 17, 1995

- This is the release of software for production of sample games.


REVISION 1.0

Date : May 3, 1995

- This is the release of software for production.

- Added German translations.

- Fixed a bug in the drop target updater which would allow the drop target to stay in the 'wrong' state if it was told to change while it was already busy trying to change.

- Changed track feature to allow laps during the grace period of nascar - the most obvious result of this is that the nascar lamps will be properly updated at the end of NASCAR mode.

- Drop target now only makes a sound effect when it is dropped by the player.

- Added adjustment ofr attract mode sounds and speech.

- Added broken switch logic for right ramp, underground lockup, right/left loop switches and right return lane.

- Trough test now makes sure the drop target is down at the beginning of the test.

- Added two score fonts to the system to accomodate a 10 billion single player score and a 10 billion multi-player 'player up' score.

- Increased flipper Skill Shot to 50 million.

- Fixed 'match' text to fit on screen.

- Added a bunch of lamp, display and sound effects.

- Ball search is now held off during video mode.

- Fixed up the auto-plunger to correctly check game over conditions.


REVISION 1.1

Date : May 15, 1995

- Added French translations.

- Changed the default adjustment for Raceway Start to AUTO.

- Change the default Raceway Holdover Difficulty to HARD.

- Changed the auto-percentage of Raceways to start with 2 lit instead of 3 by default.

- Implemented the 'dice match' feature. Added an adjustment to use the old match display.

- Fixed a glitch in the multiball start display.


Version 2.0

Date : June 8, 1995

- The game now checks the ramp magnet optos to see if any are stuck closed at initialization. If so, they are considered to be disabled until the next powerup (or test mode) that sees them un-stuck.

- Added user report messages for stuck and disabled magnet optos. Changed broken switch logic on drop target to make sure that it does not try to change the position of the drop target unnecessarily; thus allowing the player to get to the shot behind it more easily. This then allows locks to be lit much easier when the drop target is broken.


REVISION 2.2

Date : September 14, 1995

- Fixed a bug where the state of the errors for the optos being stuck and the drop target being flakey were not being cleared at factory reset, so the user could get erroneous errors randomly, based on the state of the CMOS RAM before the reset.

- Fixed a bug in the user-error report where line 2 of of the error message was not being cleared properly. This would cause messages such as 'check drop target, not set' instead of just having 'check drop target'.

- Added logic to watch the drop target for 15 games to make sure that is is lighting locks. Gives a message if 15 games go by without a lock.

- Corrected the updating of the buy-in button lamp to make sure it is updated whenever credits are added. Before, it would not start blinking until the player had put in MORE than the required credits for buying in.

- Allowed the buy-in button to enter initials during the high score to date entry screen.


REVISION 2.3

Date : September 14, 1995

- Improved the ball search logic to better compensate for a broken switch at the right popper.

- Changed the Skill Shot choice to start after the plunge, not before. This keeps the choice from being available until the ball actually arrives at the shooter.

- Fixed a bug where choosing LOCK from the skill shot would remove the 3rd lit lock if the player already had it lit.

- Fixed score histogram labels.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


During Attract mode, press the following sequence : 

Message : B, 8L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 6L, 2R


Achieve a high score and enter the initials MOO, the skull will now say 'moo' after your credit award.


Press and hold the Extra Ball button at the beginning of Air Challenge and hit the Skydive when it´s still at 25M. You are now awarded 50M and a MK3 hint.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1997.

- UPDATES -


Game ROM G11 Revision 1.0 (changes since prototype 0.5)

Date : December 1, 1997

- This is the release of software for production.

- Added German, French and Spanish translations

- Fixed german default pricing

- Fixed broken Time per Credit bookkeeping entry.

- Tournament mode rules adjusted.

- Many new lamp and display improvements.

- Improved broken switch and gofer compensation.

- Some speech improvements.

- Added Gofer test and Ordered Lamp test

- Added Hole-in-One and Daily Champions

- Fixed bug in Super Drive.

- Added difficulty preset adjustments

- Fixed ramp count bug on 5th multiball wave.

- Fixed a bug that prevented Hole in One challenge from starting off a true hole-in-one.

- More support for burn-in testing


Game ROM G11 Revision 1.2

Date : February 16, 1998

- Added new adjustment A2.32 (KICK DOWN MIDDLE). This adjustment (defaults to NO) turns off the kick from the Putting Green down towards the flippers.  The kick will still happen at the start of Mulitball, but all other arrivals will be passed to the jet bumpers. Setting this to YES reverts to the original action.

- Improved switch handling for the Golf Cart toy.

- Changed rules slightly to light the Slam Ramp for one shot when a gofer is whacked.

- Changed Golf Stroke rules. Every hole starts at 7, the count drops by hitting gofer, making a drive shot, or putting out.

- Fixed a bug in status report.

- Some lamp and display glitches fixed.

- Improved kickback coil fire timing.

- Speech has been made a little more player-friendly :

From designer Louis Koziarz: In software revisions before 1.2, if you restarted a game sometimes you would get this script :

Bud : 'Welcome back!'

Buzz : 'NOW GO AWAY!'

We had a few complaints that this was a little harsh on players, so the call was removed for the 1.2 release. That's all. The 'go away' quote was also spoken sometimes in attract mode if you pressed the flippers and attract mode sound was set to ON, that was removed as well.


Game ROM G11 Revision 1.3

Date : April 6, 1998

- Improved ball search and missing ball compensation.

- Improved Hole-in-One Challenge interaction with Ripoff and Pop-A-Gofer.

- Some display and speech improvements.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


During Attract mode, press the following sequence : 

Design Team : B, 16R, 1L, 13R, 1L, 12R, 1L

Once entered you have to wait 5 minutes until you can do it again.

- UPDATES -


REVISION L-1

Date : October 7, 1994

- Initial release to production.


REVISION L-2

Date : October 10, 1994

- Fixed a serious bug in the exploding font effect. When jumpered for Germany, which causes periods to be exploded, some games would crash.


REVISION L-3

Date : October 12, 1994

- Added the last of the German translations. This also fixes 2 phrases which were too long to fit on the screen in the Albuquerque effect.

- Fixed a bug where sometimes the 'select a souvenir' computer noise was not getting killed.


REVISION L-4

Date : October 26, 1994

- Fixed the adjustment STARTING DAY. If it was set to anything but MONDAY, it would score and make a sound at game start.

- Fixed the Special award. It was awarding a special from either lane if either lamp was lit.

- Changed default BALL SAVE TIME to ON.

- Added 26 score levels to the spinner scoring so that it doesn't MAX as fast.

- If LONGER PATH was set to OFF, there was a possibility of the first city being Atlanta. It has been fixed to allow only New York City or Miami.

- Put in French translations.

- Fixed up some effects.

- Changed it so you can now go to MIAMI from the west coast.

- Put SPAIN 2 and coin meter into Spanish preset.

- Fixed a problem with Super Payday. It was sometimes fetching an incorrect award and displaying 'HOULTON 0,000,000'.

- Fixed display and speech in Atlanta. If the player aborted the instructions and quickly made the blast zone shot, the display would behave incorrectly.


REVISION L-5

Date : December 15, 1994

- Fixed a few French translations.

- Changed Special and Replay % for France. Turned on Match for France.

- With TOURNAMENT set to YES, the souvenirs are awarded in order instead of randomly.

- Shut 'Red' up when the wheel isn't lit on a bridge-out.

- Fixed the Spinner value. It was not ever being initialized, so that it would carry over from ball to ball and game to game.

- Fixed a small display glitch in the Nashville award.

- Fixed a TILT problem with Flying Rocks. It was possible to restart start Flying Rocks after a TILT.

- Changed to only 1 replay level for Germany.

- Accumulated bonus credit fractions are cleared at the end of ball, unless coins have been inserted recently.

- After 9 minutes of idle time, any credit fractions less than 1/2 are cleared.


REVISION L-6

Date : October 11, 1995

- Fixed XX bonus display.

- Fixed display bug in New Orleans mode. It was displaying the incorrect score value for the next shot.

- Fixed a bug in Super Payday where the wrong city and score was awarded. This bug only showed up on multi-player games.

- Added adjustment for the shaker motor (default=NORMAL). Values are NORMAL, SOFT, and OFF

- Added adjustment to allow buyins once a player has reached the West Coast (default=OFF).

- Fixed blinking lamp in blast zone from 2x Atlanta blast. The lamp was being left on.

- Fixed ALL TARGETS SCORE 16,xxx,xxx display bug in Super Payday introduction screen.

- Added jackpot compensation for broken Red mouth switch.

- Multiball restart timer is now paused while ball is in the lockup (e.g. for Extra Ball display effect).

- Enhanced the handling of the proximity switches in front of Ted and Red. They are now better debounced in case they are intermittent.

- Added special code to limit the amount of time the Red and Ted eyelids are activated to prevent the coils from overheating.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Construction Mania : When you visit Bob's Souvenir Bunker and the display shows the bunker with the sign 'Uranium Ore $3 a Chunk' in the window, quickly hit both flippers twice. All targets are now worth 3M for 20 seconds.


Secret Video mode : Enter the High Score list (the daily High Score list will do as well) and press the following combination instead of your initials :

B, 3R, 2L, 2R, 1L. This only works if the billboard at Bob's Bunker has displayed 'Hidden Video Mode : BRRRLLRRL' when visited. This isn´t really a Video mode but a cool thing nonetheless!


Fun Message : B, 8L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 6L, 2R (works in attract mode as well as during gameplay). This code is also used in "No Fear and ST : TNG", knowing this makes more sense to the message!


Achieve a high score and enter the initials 'TED'.

Midway WPC-95

Model Number : 90003


Main CPU : M6809 (@ 2 MHz)

Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 MHz)

Sound chip : DMA-driven DAC


- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1996. 1,148 units were produced.


This game was originally supposed to be based on the Monopoly board-game, but Midway was unable to secure the licensing rights for the game. Ironically, Pat Lawlor (who designed Safe Cracker) would produce the Monopoly pinball game for Stern Pinball in 2001.


The red button can be found on the backglass held out through Bob's getaway rental van. It is also seen on one of the tokens that are awarded from the machine. 


One of the '?' awards is a cow head. 


One of the Candy 2000 codes is MOO, which gives you a Vault letter.


The letters BCM can be seen in the animation for when you enter the board game via the cellar entrance. The letters are to the far right on the DMD and can only be seen in the beginning of the animation. In the same animation you can see a DOHO on the sewer lid.


- UPDATES -


REVISION 1.0 (changes from prototype 0.91) :

Date : April 29, 1996

- Initial release to production.

- Ordered Lamp Test implemented

- Conditions of the optos at powerup are tested to help determine if the 12V supply is not working.

- Added the continue/quit choices back to the board game.

- Defaults : On for GERMANY, off for USA.

- Increased the duty cycle of the ramp divertor slightly to compensate for divertors that were not able to hold the mechanism in when flash bulbs were firing.

- Changed the token spitter process(es) to not log audits for vended tokens during test mode. During test, error cases are cleared out, but no feature audits are chalked.

- Added more specific token errors to the user-report for each particular side, empty and consecutive misses. Also, made sure not to report token system errors if the tokens are turned off via the feature adjustment.

- Added more robust code to the token releasing code to help with broken switch(es), and to help the operator better diagnose what the game thinks is wrong.

- Reworked logic when you reach the vault to handle cases where tokens are allowed but the mech is marked jammed. The player now will get a REPLAY if permissible, with a magic credit powerup, if the feature has been enabled.

- Changed the sequencing of the REPLAY effect if you win one as you reach the vault.

- The 'magic token accept timers' are totally functional. Both flippers or the start button will speed up the timer. Credit button presses while the timer is running will be eaten. Once the last token is inserted, a display effect of the 'credits' flavor is launched to tell the player that their last token was credited.

- Implemented a family mode adjustment. If the adjustment is set, the cop will not get shot at during the beginning of assault mode.

- The lamp effect for a whole drop bank shot during TNT multiball no longer uses the wheel lights. This is so players can see that the mode is adding time.

-  Left kicker now spots a drop target if an entrance is not lit.

- Player's wheel position is now restored each ball during multi player games.


REVISION 1.1

Date : May 6, 1996

- Added French language text translations.

- When a magic token is set to give the player a credit, the free-play percentage audit is now chalked when the token is inserted.

- Added an adjustment to make the knob-numbers random during spins. Some players were able to pick their numbers entirely too often, which made the odds of success much too high. Choices are YES (random) and NO (sequential). This adjustment factory sets to YES (random).

- Changed the replay system so that scores accumulated during Assault on the Vault are not counted in the auto replay percentaging database.

- Fixed message and choreography when a token is won from the gift lady or '?' game. In version 1.0, these cases would say 'free credit' instead of 'free token', and wouldn't wait long enough for the token to be released.

- Patched a bug in the lamp effect system that would sometimes cause the game to crash when the assault mode jackpot shot was hit.

- New rule added for 'call guard'. This is now a random chance of the guard letting you into the board game for free.

- Fixed the coil test for the ramp - it got broken in version 1.0 when the duty cycle was increased.

- Removed the 'guards moved' from bonus and status.

- Added a basic top trough test.

- Filled in the sound test table.

- Hid all token adjustments when the tokens are turned off.

- Disabled token-input when the tokens are turned off.

- Added 'number of board games played' audits : these audits tell how many players played the board game exactly 1,2,3 or 4 times in the same game.

- Collecting the "assault from all sides" award in assault mode now awards vault letters.


REVISION 1.2

Date : May 13, 1996

- Put in support for new German speech.

- Fixed the screens for the tests of the auxiliary lamps.


REVISION 1.4

Date : June 11, 1996

- Added support for more printers through the optional serial port.

- Completed Spanish translations.

- Made the factory default for French have the maximum tokens per player set to 1.

- Added the adjustment A.1.14 : REPLAY AWARD which allows the operator to turn off replays.

- Attract mode now shows the number of tokens available in the vault jackpot.

- Added 2 new feature adjustments :

LOCK FOR BANK - This adjustment determines whether the player must lock a ball before playing the board game.

YES : player must lock at least 1 ball before break in

NO : player must only complete drop banks to break in

Default is YES

START BANK LIT - This adjustment determines whether the bank is lit for a break in at game start. Default is NO

Implemented adjustment A.1.16 which allows match to award credits or tokens. NOTE : Tokens paid out by Match are NOT included in A.2.21 : 'TOKEN PAYOUT %'.  The match percentage is governed by adjustment A.1.19 : 'MATCH FEATURE'.

When match is set to token in the 'N' version of the software, the match percentage is fixed at 5%.

- Fixed a condition in token multiball which could allow a player to win more tokens than were available in the vault jackpot.

- Changed logic so that if the token tubes run out or become jammed in the middle of token multiball, the player will get points as a substitution.

- Changed the minimum allowed value for adjustment A.2.7 : 'TIMER STARTS AT' to 15 minutes.

- Fixed a problem where under some conditions, the game would not allow you to change adjustments.


REVISION 1.5

Date : August 2, 1996

- Adjustment A.2.22 (MAGIC TOK. ACCEPT) has been modified to allow the token to be used for BUY-IN. The BUY-IN setting allows tokens won during a game to be used to extend the current game.

- Changes made to reset the board game if the game is tilted while playing the board game.

- The audit for matches now properly chalks an audit for match when the match gives a token.


REVISION 1.6

Date : September 13, 1996

- TRIVIA -


Skateball had a faulty design that allowed players to score excessive points, lowering operator profits due to many free games being awarded. Players could easily hold the ball on the right flipper and make it roll in and out of the right inlane by briefly releasing the flipper button. This caused the bonus to raise to the maximum award which would award a special upon reaching 60k. Operators reportedly tried a number of different solutions to solve the problem.

Prior to Prohibition, the saloons admitted only men as patrons, but as speakeasies they allowed both men and women.

You can also see this animation at the beginning of Multiball : Fire the first shot, miss the second and then hit both flippers.

This might only work on games with software revision LX-7.


* Press both flipper buttons when Data says : 'Had you had propelled the ball on the proper trajectory you would have been rewarded!' Picard will interrupt him with 'Thank you, Mr. Data!', and you are awarded 10 million points. This is only said when losing a "bad" ball.

Striker Xtreme (c) 2000 Stern Pinball.


It's the International Soccer Championship and your country is in contention for the cup. You're the team's most valuable striker and you've been given one simple job : SCORE GOALS!


Sixteen teams have qualified for the tournament and you will need to defeat each one of them in order to celebrate victory. France, U.S.A., Spain, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, England, Brazil, Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are all in contention, with each team becoming increasingly difficult to beat as you advance through the tournament. So use your three flippers and the corner kickback to score goals as the commentator calls out the play-by-play in one of five languages : English, Italian, French, Spanish or German.


As team striker, there are several shots that you're being counted on to make: corner kicks, free kicks, throw-in shots, penalty kicks, and shootouts. But the opponent's goalie, with his belly-mounted target, will be there to stop you with each attempt. So as the competition grows more intense, so do your scoring chances in the Xtreme rounds and in both Stadium and Celebration Multi-Ball modes. Good luck striker...the team is counting on you!

Tee'd Off (c) 1993 Gottlieb / Premier Technology.


- TECHNICAL -


Gottlieb System 3

Model Number : 736


- TRIVIA -


A Gottlieb employee began the pinball line 'Premier' in 1984 after buying out the company's assets to avert bankruptcy. Victory also shares this dual branding. Tee'd Off was partially inspired by the movie 'Caddyshack'. An animating gopher named Gunther sat atop the backglass and moved along with audio that constantly taunted the player.


3,500 units were produced.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The goal of Tee'd Off is to complete each of the five rounfs, and score lots of points along the way! The blinking ball shows which round you are playing. When the round is successfully completed, it will remain lit. Before you activate a round you are just shooting for holes, so let's begin there. The goal is to complete all nine holes by getting them all in order. Holes 1, 6, and 9 are in the volcano and holes 2, 4, and 8 are reached by going up the ramp. Scoring all nine holes on your first ball gives you multi-ball mode. In this mode you can earn extra jackpot bonuses by hittinh the captive ball, or by hitting the target by the strobing table lights. When you finish the ninth hole on your second ball you get raining cats and dogs multi-ball mode.

- TRIVIA -


Based on the hit 1992 movie; stars Raul Julia (Gomez) and Anjelica Huston (Morticia) provided custom speech for this game.


The following is a list of the musical pieces in The Addams Family :

- Addams Theme : Played at the beginning of your first ball until you plunge the ball into play.  lso played during attract mode and the explanation of 'Tour the Mansion'.

- Normal Game Theme : Played during normal game play, when no special rounds are active.

- Mamushka Theme : Played during the Mamushka round.

- Cousin It Theme : Played during Cousin It round.

- Tunnel Hunt Theme : Played during Tunnel Hunt round.

- Seance Theme : Hardly music, but played during Seance round.

- Raise the Dead Theme : Played during Raise the Dead round.

- Thing Multiball Countdown Theme

- Quick/Thing Multiball Theme : Played during quick MB rounds.

- Multiball Release Theme : Played while two balls are locked and you're trying to lock the third for Multiball.

- Multiball Theme : Played until you score your first jackpot.

- Jackpot Theme : Played after you score a jackpot UNTIL YOU END THAT BALL, even after multiball is over. It's a souped-up version of the Addams Theme. It's also the Enter Initials Theme.

- Multiball Restart Theme : Played while Thing Multiball restart is lit, it's just one particular part of the Addams Theme being played over and over. The same music is also played while the features of 'Tour the Mansion' are being explained.


The Addams Family introduced the concept of a game-controlled flipper. About 20,270 units was made.


In October 1994, The Addams Family was put back in production with a special run of 'Gold Edition' machines to commemorate the machine becoming the best selling machine of all time. Each 'Gold Edition' machine includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team and a gold plate on the lower right front of the machine containing the machine number.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General Playfield Description and Basic Rules :

1. Million Plus Ramp : Each left ramp shot scores 1M, 2M, 3M, etc. up to a maximum of 10M; this value resets at the beginning of each ball. Each shot also lights a letter in THING if THING has not yet been completed, spots the first unlit GRAVE target, and feeds the ball (with a properly working diverter) to Thing’s Flipper. This ramp is also used to collect Stars and to score Super Jackpots during multiball. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130 points in both directions and loudly fires the ramp diverter.


2. Bear Kick Ramp : Each center ramp shot awards 1 Bear Kick (2 when lit via the near left inlane), lights the Electric Chair if it is not lit, and returns the ball down the right inlane. When Thing Flips is lit, it sends the ball to Thing’s flipper instead. Extra balls and free mansion rooms are awarded at various numbers of bear kicks. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130 points in both directions. It is also the 'V' grave target. See 'Bear Kicks'.


3. Electric Chair : Located just above the left flipper. When the yellow lamp is lit, it awards the currently flashing Mansion Room and kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the left flipper. When the red lamp is lit, it begins Multi-Ball. The right inlane lights the chair for a mansion room temporarily; either the center ramp or the left ramp lights it permanently. On normal settings, the Electric Chair is lit at the beginning of each ball (note : for the remainder of the rules sheet, to say that the 'electric chair is lit' means that the yellow lamp above the electric chair is lit).


4. Swamp Kickout : Awards mansion rooms whenever the Electric Chair ordinarily would (i.e. The yellow lamp is lit). Kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the right flipper. This shot is also the 'E' target.


5. Swamp : Located along the right side of the playfield, just below the upper right flipper. Scores the Graveyard Value during normal play, or five times the Graveyard Value when shot via Thing’s Flipper (the opto just above the flipper must be triggered, however, to light 5X Graveyard). The swamp locks balls when lit. Balls exit the swamp through the swamp kickout.


6. Train Wreck Target : This shot is most easily made from the upper right flipper, as it was intended to be. Located to the right of the Million Plus Ramp, it scores 1M ordinarily; at certain levels, it scores 5M and a 'Train Wreck'. Each Train Wreck prevents the Graveyard Value from resetting at the beginning of the next ball. On normal settings, four Train Wrecks lights an extra ball. The first Train Wreck takes 2 hits; the second takes 3 hits; and so on up to a maximum of 6 hits per train wreck.


7. Graveyard Bumpers : Advances the Graveyard Value by 10K for unlit bumpers, 20K for lit bumpers, and 30K for flashing bumpers. Bumpers are advanced by any of the unlit GRAVE targets (see below). The Graveyard value is initially 1M at the beginning of each ball (unless it has been held by a Train Wreck), and increases to a maximum of 4M. The bumpers also change the currently flashing mansion room, moving from left to right first, then bottom to top.


8. GRAVE targets : The two targets 'G' and 'R' are located just beneath the jet bumpers. 'A' is to the left of the Bear Kicks Ramp. 'V' is not an individual target but is the center ramp itself. Likewise, 'E' is the swamp kickout entrance. Complete GRAVE to score the GRAVE bonus of 2M, 3M, 4M, etc. to a maximum of 10M for the duration of the game. Each unlit GRAVE target also advances a jet bumper. Any shot to the Million Plus ramp will spot the first unlit GRAVE target.


9. Cousin It : 4 standup targets above the Electric Chair most easily hit by the upper right flipper; it ordinarily just produces a sound effect and scores 300K points. It is used mainly in the Cousin It round.


10. Bookcase/Vault : The bookcase is a large target to the right of the bear kicks ramp. Each bookcase hit spots a letter in GREED; spell GREED to open the vault (a sinkhole behind the bookcase). During multiball it also adds to the jackpot value. The vault is used to lock balls, start Multi-Ball, score Quick Multiball jackpots, and relight the Super Jackpot. Two lamps are above the vault – the red lamp is lit whenever multiball start or quick multiball jackpots are lit; the green lamp is lit whenever the vault is open to lock a ball.


11. Thing Ramp : This is a small metal ramp to the left of the Bear Kicks ramp that feeds the ball to Thing's Eject. There are two lamps above this ramp – the green lamp indicates that a shot here will lock the ball, and the yellow lamp means that 'Thing Bonus' is lit.


12. Thing's Eject : This eject is used to score the Skill Shot, and when lit starts Quick Multiball or Thing Multiball, restarts Multi- Ball, locks balls, awards THING bonus, or awards extra balls.


13. Thing : Yes, Thing himself! He resides in a box and occasionally comes out to pick up a ball in Thing's Eject, using a magnet. When he does, the ball is either carried away to the swamp, or Thing reappears and releases the ball in the eject.


14. Adv X Lane : This is a lane that runs from the back of the jet bumpers around the machine to the upper right flipper. When Adv X is lit via the right inlane, shooting this lane in either direction advances the bonus multiplier from 1 to a maximum of 5, valid only for the current ball. Regardless, shooting the lane through the bumpers to the upper right flipper lights 'Lite Star' on the Million Plus Ramp, and is used to score Combos. The lit 'Adv X' times out in a few seconds.


15. The Power : The infamous magnets beneath the playfield. 2 distinctive Williams lightning bolts in the middle of the playfield and 2 bright side flashers light up when the Power is active.


16. Near Left Inlane : Lights '2 Bear Kicks' on the center ramp. This award times out in a few seconds.


17. Far Left Inlane : Lights 'Thing Flips' on the center ramp when lit; a center ramp shot will be diverted to Thing’s flipper for an automatic flip towards the swamp. This award times out in a few seconds.  See 'Thing Flips' for more details.


18. Right Inlane : Lights 'Adv X' lane temporarily, and if the Electric Chair is unlit, lights it temporarily.


19. Swamp Millions Targets : Whenever 5X Graveyard is lit, these targets award 1M points each. There are three targets, two below and one just above the entrance to the swamp. These targets time out just as 5X Graveyard does, and can be hit multiple times until it does. They also help Thing determine how well he’s flipping.


20. Left/Right Outlanes : When lit they score 'Special' (on normal settings, this is a replay). 'Special' can only be lit by Touring the Mansion, and normally only one outlane is lit at a time.


* Skill Shot : Each time a ball is placed in the plunger lane, you have a chance to score the 'Skill Shot'. Hit the ball into Thing's eject for 2M the first time, then 3M, then 4M, and finally a maximum of 5M. These values increase for the duration of the game. Balls which do not land in the eject may circle around into the Jet Bumpers on a hard shot, miss the eject but still land in that area on a close shot, or fall into the swamp on a soft shot.

If the ball misses the eject but does not touch any playfield switch, you may safely let it drain and get the ball back. In other words, you cannot score zero points on a ball (without tilting). The switch in the plunger lane near the swamp and the one just above the plunger do not count since they score no points.


* Bear Kicks : The number of Bear Kicks accumulates throughout the game. You begin with 1 Bear Kick; each center ramp adds 1 to this value, or 2 when the '2 Bear Kicks' light has been lit via the near left inlane.

At a certain level of bear kicks, an extra ball will be lit at Thing's Eject.  This value normally reflexes according to recent game play, but it is usually around 8 or 9. It is no less than 6 bear kicks, but apparently it has no maximum.

At 15, 25, 35, and 45 bear kicks, mansion rooms are spotted. The currently flashing mansion room will be awarded as if you had hit the electric chair or the swamp kickout, and happens even if the electric chair is not lit. Mansion rooms are not spotted during any of the multiballs; when the multiball finishes, one more center ramp shot will spot the room.  If you shoot the lit electric chair or swamp kickout before the room is spotted, that room will be announced before the one that was spotted. The '?' panel cannot be spotted by bear kicks.

Another extra ball is available at 50 bear kicks. This value does not reflex regardless of operator settings.

Mansion rooms are also spotted at 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 bear kicks.

On the 99th bear kick, and every bear kick after that, a 'Super Bear Kick' is scored. This is just 5M points and a neat animation showing 'Super Bear Bonus'.  At this point, no more mansion rooms can be spotted, no more extra balls can be lit via the ramp, and '2 Bear Kicks' has no effect.

Each bear kick ramp shot will display the cumulative number of bear kicks so far and announce the next level to be reached for an extra ball or mansion room. There is no hint to Super Bear Kicks before reaching it on the 96th, 97th, and 98th bear kicks.


* THING Bonus : Million Plus ramp shots spot a letter in THING (spelled just beneath your score on the backglass). On normal settings, you begin the game with T-H-I already spotted. Complete THING to light THING Bonus at Thing's Eject (indicated by the yellow lamp). THING Bonus starts at 5M the first time, 10M the second time, up to a maximum of 15M. T-H-I is only spotted once (if at all).  Shooting this award causes Thing to come out of his box, but the ball is set back down into the eject when the animation finishes.

'Lite Star' is lit whenever you shoot the left orbit. It remains lit until either it times out in a few seconds or you miss the left ramp shot from the upper right flipper. When this lamp is lit, the left ramp also lights a Star on the backglass. You can light up to two stars in this fashion, and when you collect the Thing Bonus, each star is worth 5M. This value does not increase.

On very early prototypes, the yellow lamp above the Thing Ramp was also lit to lock balls since there was no green lamp. Also, early versions carried over the value of the Million Plus ramp from ball to ball by default.


* THING Flips : Whenever Thing Flips is lit in the far left inlane, shots to the bear kick ramp are sent down the left chute to the left mini-flipper. Thing will flip the ball for you; hopefully it should land in the swamp most of the time. The machine uses artificial intelligence and maintains data from previous flips to determine how it's doing. It tries to maintain a success rate between 40% and 60% (while normal players usually average around a 25% success rate), though on properly maintained machines it can be almost perfect.

The Swamp Millions targets are lit, so if Thing misses you may be able to pick up some points there. The standard Graveyard timer is still in effect, so Swamp 5X will remain lit for a few seconds on a miss. If Thing misses but hits some swamp targets, the machine tries to recalculate things for the next flip based on the landing of the shot (high or low).

After 3 complete misses, the machine will throw out all the data and start from scratch. There is also a menu option that will let you manually reset all of the data.

Thing Flips is not lit in the inlane during multiball, multiball restart, or Thing Multiball countdown.


* Multi-Ball : The first step in getting to multiball is lighting locks. You light locks by spelling G-R-E-E-D (hitting the bookcase the appropriate number of times). On your first multiball, the first switch you trigger each ball spots a letter. You can also gain a 'cheat' GREED letter by tilting. When G-R-E-E-D is spelled, the bookcase opens and the vault is revealed.

If the ball happens to go into the vault while the bookcase is closed, GREED will automatically be spelled, the bookcase will open instantly, and the first ball is locked. This is called a 'dirty pool'.

For the first multiball, Thing's Eject and the Vault will lock your first ball (indicated by the green lamps). Lock one ball to serve another to the plunger, unless no balls are in the trough, in which case one will be kicked out from the Swamp Kickout. You may lock this second ball in Thing's Eject, the Vault, or the Swamp. Locking two balls lights both the Electric Chair and the Vault (the red lamps) to release all balls and begin Multi-Ball, and also turns on the Power magnets.

Once the third ball is locked, all balls will be released. The first and third balls will come from the Swamp Kickout; the second will come from either the Electric Chair or the Swamp Kickout, depending on where the last ball was locked.

The initial jackpot value is 10M.  Shoot the Train Wreck target to collect the Jackpot. Shoot the Million Plus Ramp to score the Super Jackpot (for the first multiball, this is a Double Jackpot). After collecting a Jackpot or Super Jackpot, the vault will open; shoot a ball in the vault to relight the Super Jackpot.

During multiball, bookcase hits and center ramp shots add 1M to the jackpot, up to its maximum value of 25M. By default the jackpot value increases until it is awarded, between multiballs and multiball restarts. Once the jackpot is collected, the jackpot value resets to 10M. You can continue to collect Super Jackpots as long as you can keep two balls in play.

If you fail to collect a Jackpot, you can restart multiball by shooting Thing's Eject within 20 seconds. During this time no mansion rooms or stars can be collected, Thing Flips is not lit, and all center ramp shots will be sent to the right flipper. The Power is not active during multiball restart.

Restart is a two-ball multiball, and begins immediately after plunging the second ball into play. The skill shot here can set up a pretty easy shot at the Train Wreck target and the Left Ramp. Both the Jackpot and Super Jackpot are lit after the restart. However, if you can't hit Thing's Eject, well, 'sorry old man', multiball ends. There is only one restart per multiball.

Mansion rooms, Stars, Swamp 5X, and Thing Flips cannot be collected during this and any other multiballs.

For the second and subsequent multiballs on normal settings, you must spell GREED via five bookcase hits, and only the Vault will lock balls one and two. The third can be locked in the electric chair or the vault on the second multiball, but only the Vault will be able to lock ball three to start the third Multiball. Super Jackpot is three times the base Jackpot value.

In a multi-player game, it is possible for one player to 'unlock' another player's locked balls. For each unlock, the swamp will be lit to relock the ball. This is regardless of difficulty settings or which level of multiball you are playing. The ball can be easily locked again just by plunging softly so that the ball falls right into the swamp from the plunger lane; it's a nice fix to the 'stolen balls' problem common in manual plunger games.




Mansion Rooms : There are twelve rooms in the Addams' mansion that can be collected by shooting either the electric chair or the swamp kickout when the yellow lamp is lit. The next mansion room to be awarded will be flashing; rooms that have already been awarded will be solidly lit. The jet bumpers change the currently flashing room.

At the beginning of the game, and after the mansion is reset because you Toured, either 'Mamushka' or 'Cousin It' will be the currently flashing room.

The total number of mansion rooms collected over the course of the game is counted and contributes to your end of ball bonus.

Mansion rooms can also be spotted by hitting the bear kick ramp enough times; see 'Bear Kicks'.

When all twelve rooms have been awarded, the Question Mark is lit in the Attic.  Collecting the '?' starts 'Tour the Mansion' (see below). You do not have the relight the electric chair/swamp kickout via the ramps or the right inlane in order to collect this award. You can't spot '?' via Bear Kicks. Each mansion room is described below :


1. Mansion 3 Million : Awards 3 million, and on normal settings, spots the 6M mansion room if it has not yet been collected.


2. Mansion Graveyard at Max : Advances all jet bumpers to flashing status; each jet now advances the Graveyard value by 30K until the end of the current ball.


3. Mansion Hit Cousin It : This is a 20 second timed round, during which all targets score 200K. Each hit to Cousin It, however, increases the target value by 50K, and scores 2M points.

The timer used in this and all other timed rounds will stop whenever any ball in play is in an eject or a tunnel. This means that rounds which continue into regular multiball tend to last a lot longer than 20 or 30 seconds. It will also stop temporarily during a ball search but then restarts again.

Also, the target value is scored for every switch tripped, so the ramps and sinkhole shots will always trip more than one switch.

Your Cousin It bonus starts out at 1M.


4. Mansion The Mamushka : This is a 20 second timed round during which all targets score 250K. There is no way to increase the target value.

Your Mamushka bonus starts out at 1M.


5. Mansion 6 Million : Awards 6 million points, and spots the 3M mansion room if it has not yet been awarded.


6. Mansion Quick Multiball : Lights Quick Multiball at Thing's Eject. This remains lit until it is collected (by default). You cannot lock balls at Thing's Eject or collect the Thing Bonus while it is lit. It becomes unavailable temporarily during any multiball.

Shoot Thing's Eject to begin. Thing will take the ball and send it to the swamp kickout; another ball will be served to the plunger unless two balls have been locked, in which case it will come from the Swamp Kickout. During Quick Multiball, the Vault will be open and will score 5M points. This value increases by 1M each time 'Vault Millions' is collected or the center ramp is hit, up to a maximum value of 10M.

There may be some problems with this round or Thing Multiball whenever Tunnel Hunt is running; see 'Mansion Tunnel Hunt'.

If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball is lit, Thing Multiball only will be started instead.


7. Mansion Tunnel Hunt : This is a 20 second timed round in which you should shoot the three tunnel shots : the electric chair, the swamp (or swamp kickout), and the vault. They may be shot in any order. The first scores 5M, the second is worth 10M, and the third is worth 15M.

If the electric chair is lit, hitting the electric chair during Tunnel Hunt will also award another mansion room (Same goes for the swamp kickout).

If the vault was previously lit for lock, you will not be able to lock balls during Tunnel Hunt. It will relight at the end of the round. Once the vault has been hit, it will close. If Quick Multiball or Thing Multiball is running, it may or may not close (hopefully it won't, of course).

Plunging a ball into the swamp while Tunnel Hunt is running does not give credit for the tunnel. Hitting the bookcase during Tunnel Hunt when the vault should be open will not convince the game to open it.


8. Mansion Seance : This is a 20 second timed round during which the next three ramp shots (either Million Plus or Bear Kick ramp) will score 5M, 10M, and 15M each. The Power magnets are enabled throughout the round.

Bear Kick ramps will always feed to Thing's mini-flipper, except when Thing Multiball is counting down. Thing Flips is still possible during Seance.


9. Mansion 9 Million : Awards 9 million points!


10. Mansion Thing Multiball : Much like Quick Multiball, this is a count-down award lit at Thing's Eject. Hitting this immediately scores 15M, but this value counts down quickly to 3M before it expires. There is a short grace period once the timer reaches 3M. Shoot Thing's Eject to score the value immediately and set the value of the vault during Thing Multiball.

During the countdown, ALL bear kick shots will return the ball to the right inlane, no matter what. Thing Flips inlane is not lit during the countdown or the actual multiball.

A second ball is sent to the plunger if possible (see 'Quick Multiball' for details if this is not the case), and multi-ball play begins as soon as it is plunged, in the same manner as Quick Multiball. However, the value of the vault is fixed and cannot be increased.

If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball is lit, Thing Multiball will be started instead, and Quick Multiball cannot be collected until Thing Multiball ends.

If you have spotted Thing Multiball by bear kicks, you can shoot Thing before the mansion fanfare finishes. However, you will NOT be awarded the instant 15M points. The vault value is still fixed to 15M and an otherwise normal Thing Multiball continues.


11. Mansion Raise the Dead : This award starts a 30 second timed round in which hits to the jet bumpers add to your Raise the Dead bonus. The bumpers will all flash, even though this award has nothing to do with the normal status of the jets (unlit, lit, and flashing). Shoot each bumper four times to score 3M points; each bumper hit is also worth 100K also. The Raise the Dead bonus begins at 2M.

Whenever one of the bumpers is hit for the fourth time, it becomes solidly lit. The dot matrix will show you a grave for each of the bumpers and how many more times each bumper needs to be hit.

When all bumpers have been hit four times, the round ends immediately. You can, however, continue to collect 100K per hit for bumpers which have already been hit four times until the round is over.


12. Mansion Extra Ball : This simply lights an Extra Ball at Thing's Eject.  Under normal settings, it will remain lit until collected.


* Tour the Mansion : Whenever the 12th mansion award has been collected or started, the electric chair will be re-lit automatically and the '?' will be flashing. Shooting the chair (or swamp kickout, of course) will start 'Tour the Mansion', which is as follows :

- All of the mansion rooms become unlit. Basically, Tour the Mansion has a lot in common with Whirlwind in that the mega-award is simply to re-award everything (almost everything, actually).

- 50 million points is awarded (as clearly indicated by Gomez). The 3M, 6M, and 9M rooms light up at this point.

- 'Special' is lit in the outlanes. By default, these outlanes are 'hard', meaning that only one of them is lit at a time, changing whenever a slingshot is hit. Quick Multiball lights up now, even though it has nothing to do with Specials.

- The Graveyard is maximized (all jet bumpers flash). The corresponding room is lit.

- An extra ball is lit at Thing's Eject, and the EB room is lit.

- Each of the remaining room rounds is started one at a time, in the following order : Mamushka, Hit Cousin It, Seance, Tunnel Hunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball. The first five are all timed and end as soon as the timer expires or you drain. Thing Multiball ends if you fail to start the round (as usual by shooting Thing's Eject), or if you do start two-ball play, when you return to one ball.

Any rounds running when the Tour is started continue to run during the Tour. It is extremely distressing if you have to contend with the Power during the Tour because you were running the Seance round.

If you reach a number of bear kicks that would ordinarily spot a mansion room while Touring, that free room is wasted. It does not carry over to the next mansion, nor does it affect Tour the Mansion in any way.

If you complete all of the above, the Tour ends quietly. For the remainder of that ball, you will be unable to collect mansion awards.

The extra ball lit by Touring is 'hard' by default; it must be collected on that ball or it will disappear. Likewise, 'Special' will also be unavailable after the ball ends.

Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead bonuses collected before Touring carry over into the Tour, i.e. your base totals for the round are what you had before you toured, plus the 1M or 2M normally given for starting the round.

'?' itself doesn't technically count as a mansion room since it is not considered as such for the purpose of adding your end-of-ball bonus.


* End of Ball Bonus : Bonus is calculated at the end of each ball as follows :

- 100K for each bear kick, up to the maximum 99.

- 500K for each mansion room, with no apparent limit. The display will probably appear garbled, though, when you have more than 99.

- The sum of the above is multiplied by the bonus multiplier.

- Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead totals are added.

Scoring 20M or more in bonus generates a quote from Gomez : 'Who says you can't take it with you?'  However, the quote will not be delivered unless you played at least one round during the ball.


* Combos : There are two 3-way combos, worth 5M each : Right inlane, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp, Swamp.

And one 4-way combo, worth 10M : Bear kick ramp, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus ramp, Swamp.

Scoring the 4-way combo also awards the points for the 3-way combo (since the first 3 of the 4 forms one of the 3-way combos). This makes the 4-way very valuable : 15M + bonus X advanced + at least 1M from the ramp + at least 5M for the 5X graveyard value + 5M for the Star when you collect Thing Bonus.


* Defaults : here is a list of game features that can be altered by the operator. Normally these are left alone, but adjusting the overall difficulty of the machine or setting games to 5-balls will change a lot of these.

1. Extra Ball Percent : desired % of games in which the first Bear Kick extra ball should be collected. This value is used internally to reflex the number of bear kicks required. Range is 15-40% It can also be set to FIXED such that the first bear kick extra ball level does not reflex. Default is 25%.


2. 1st Bear Kick extra ball level : set 1. to fixed and this option will set the number of bear kicks required for the first extra ball. Default is 8.


3. 2nd Bear Kick extra ball level : This value ranges from 30-99 and does not reflex. Default is 50.


4. Train Wreck Extra Ball Available : Default is to award extra balls at a certain number of train wrecks.


5. Bear Kick EB Memory : Default is to hold between balls.


6. House EB Memory : Default is to hold between balls.


7. Train Wreck EB Memory : Default is to hold between balls.


8. Last Thing Lock : This is the final multiball level on which Thing will lock balls. Default is for the first multiball only. This value ranges from 0-5.


9. Last Swamp Lock : This is the final multiball level on which the Swamp will light to lock ball two. Default is for the first multiball only. The value ranges from 1-5.


10. Last Chair Release : This is the final multiball level on which the electric chair can be shot to start multiball. Default is for the first and second multiballs. The value ranges from 0-5.


11. Jackpot Carryover : When set this retains the value of the jackpot until it is hit; when off, the jackpot will reset at the end of each multiball or multiball restart. Default is to carryover jackpots.


12. Million Plus Memory : Default is to reset the value of the Million Plus at the end of each  ball.


13. Million Plus Maximum : Default upper limit of the Million Plus is 10M. This value can range from 5M to 20M.


14. Thing Multiball Start : This value can range from 10M to 20M. Default starting value of Thing Multiball is 15M.


15. Room from Swamp : Default is to award mansion rooms from the swamp kickout.


16. Free THING Letters : Up to 5 THING letters can be spotted at the beginning of the game. Default is 3.


17. Raise the Dead Hits : The number of hits per jet bumper can be set from 3-9. Default is 4.


18. Train Wreck Hits : By default, 2 hits are required for the first Train Wreck. This value can range from 2-4. Successive train wrecks always require 1 more hit up to the maximum of 6.


19. Special Memory : By default, specials disappear at the end of the current ball.


20. Train Wreck Memory : By default, the train wreck hits count carries over between balls.


21. Quick Multiball Memory : By default, Quick Multiball will remain lit between balls until it is hit.


22. Tour EB Memory : By default, the Extra Ball lit during Tour the Mansion will disappear at the end of the current ball.


23. Tour Difficulty. Default is a medium setting, in which the 6M and 3M rooms are counted as one room. On the hard setting, each must be collected separately.


* During Attract mode, with no credits, press the following button sequence (L : left flipper, R : Right flipper, S : Start button):

Design Team : 13L, 1S, 1R, 1S, 2L, 1S

'When Cows Fight' picture : 7L, 1S, 14R, 1S, 20L, 1S. DOHO can be seen on the chainsaw blade which the cow on the right is holding.

'When Cows Dig for Gold' picture (Gold Edition only) : 12L, 1S, 5R, 1S, 4L, 1S


* Problems : While this game is perfect in many ways, none is completely immune to problems or failures. Here are some of the more common problems :

1. Balls can get stuck inside the swamp, on the swamp, on top of Thing's box, on jet bumpers, and on the circular plate that the bookcase sits upon. The machine will perform ball searches until it finds the missing ball -- firing all the jet bumpers and kickouts and spinning the vault. Tilting will end the current ball, but the next ball won't start until it finds the missing ball(s). The only solution short of removing the stuck ball is to power cycle the game and start over unless you have locked balls; it will kick out ALL locked balls after two or three ball searches. However, once these drain, if the ball is still lost the problem resurfaces.


2. When pressing START, the game will let you know if a pinball is missing and try to find it a couple of times, but eventually it will give up and play with what's available. There are only 3 balls installed in the machine.


3. The only diverter is located in the upper left corner where the two ramps meet. If it gets stuck, you may find all balls going to the same spot -- either the mini-flipper or the right inlane. This may or may not be a 'problem'.


4. If the machine decides that there are faulty switches (because they haven't been hit in a while), it will try to compensate. If one of the ramp switches is bad, the other ramp will award both of them. If the bookcase won't open, you can lock balls at the Thing Ramp. If Thing can't pick up the ball from the eject, then it will just remain there.

There are no changes to Palantir because it is always deterministic.

Mystery works as follows :

There are 3 categories of awards : advance multiball, complete rings, point awards. The game will cycle through categories in that order.

If nothing can be awarded in a category, then the game will move to the next category.

CPU Release : 7.00

DISPLAY Release : 7.00

Date : April 3, 2004

- Bump N Win Tournament added


DISPLAY Release : 8.00

Date : July 13, 2004

- New Adjustment support added.

- Destroy the Ring Champion support added.


CPU Release : 8.00

Date : July 13, 2004

- Flipper code rewritten. The game now uses the EOS switch where available to turn off power to the flippers earlier.  This should generally result in the flippers staying MUCH cooler over a longer period of time and reduce player dissatisfaction on a heavily-played game.

- 3 adjustments were added to control the flippers.

Standard Adj 53 : Specifies the minimum flipper fire time in ms.

Standard Adj 54 : Specifies the maximum flipper fire time in ms.

Standard Adj 55 : Specifies extra fire time after reaching EOS in ms.

- Hopefully fixed multiball devices waiting for the Palantir Lit display effect.

- Fixed Cave Troll jackpot value not being initialized properly.

- Changed bonus scoring so that scores would end in odd 10s digits more often.

- Changed Ring opto dispatches so they won't score during Destroy the Ring so that ball search can occur if it needs to.

- Added Feature Adjustment 35 "DESTROY RING # BALLS". Can be set to 1 or 2 (default is 1). Setting this to 2 will allow the ring to hold a ball and let the player try to knock it out with the 2nd ball. Setting this to 1 will cause the magnet to just hold the ball for a second then let it go, requiring the player to make a clean shot through the ring to win the mode.

- Install Director's Cut has been changed to set DESTROY RING # BALLS to 2.

- Added Destroy the Ring Champion.  This is awarded to the person who completes Destroy the Ring in the shortest amount of time.


DISPLAY Release : 9.00

Date : January 20, 2005

- New adjustment/display effect support added.


CPU Release : 9.00

Date : January 20, 2005

- New sounds/speech added and/or increased :

1) Two new quotes by Treebeard added during Ent Mode.

2) When Return of the King multiball starts, Gimli states, "Minis Tirith is under attack!"

3) While in Destroy the Ring mode, Gollum says, "My Precious!". Frodo says, "The Ring is Mine!", followed by "Gollum has the ring!"

4) One new quote by Elron added during second Fellowship multiball.

5) More frequent playing of Frodo's quote for shots up the middle- "I will take the ring to Mordor, though I do not know the way". In past software revisions, if a mode was ready at the center (ring) shot, you would not hear this particular quote, but instead hear the mode sound effects. Now you get both (with Frodo's quote first).

- Fixed Feature Adjustment 1 "RING COMBOS/LEVEL" that had its range set improperly and would cause a factory reset if a non-numerical value was chosen.

- Fixed a problem with Destroy the Ring Champion enter initials screen not doing anything when DTR Champ was earned during a TOPS tournament game.

- Feature Adjustment 5 "PALANTIR DIFFICULTY" wasn't actually implemented (until now). Oops.

- Fixed a bug where Palantir would retain memory from game to game.

- Feature Adjustment 16 "MYSTERY DIFFICULTY" wasn't actually implemented either. Oops again.

- Added a lamp effect for the Rings of Power during (Super) Ring Frenzy (MB).

- Vastly improved Destroy the Ring success choreography.

- Fixed a potential problem with Feature Adjustment #3 (1ST HARD TWO TOWERS MB).

- Fixed display of KEEP letters in bonus.

- Fixed a bunch of Destroy the Witchking choreography.

- Fixed display of extra ball and special point awards.

- Added Feature Adjustment 36 "EXTENDED ATTRACT MODE".  Can be set ON or OFF (default is OFF). When ON, the 4th then every 8th pass through attract mode will show the One Ring poem and accompanying light show.

- Added Feature Adjustment 37 'IGNORE POTD ON KICK'. Can be set to YES or NO (default is YES). When YES, the Path of the Dead switches are ignored for 1/4 second after kicking a ball because vibration would tend to set them off. The game has always behaved this way, this just gives people the opportunity to turn it off if they want to adjust their switches and the ball has a tendency to roll over one very quickly (causing it not to score).

- Changed Feature Adjustment 26 'ALLOW VOLUME EFFECTS' to 'MAXIMUM VOLUME EFFECT'. This adjustment now sets the maximum allowed difference in volume from the base volume from 0 (never change the volume) to 10 (let the game get MUCH louder than base volume). The default is 5. This just sets the maximum the game will do, it does NOT mean the game will necessarily get that loud.

- Added 'Reset Grand Champion' icon to the RESETS menu. This will reset ALL high scores to their default values as specified in Standard Adjustments 23-27. It will also restore Destroy the Ring champion to its default.

- Lots of minor misc. choreography improvements.

- Fixed The Two Towers Won audit (it wasn't chalking).

- Fixed the score histogram audits (the buckets were in reality half as much as their reported value).


DISPLAY Release : 10.00

Date : October 28, 2005

- New adjustment/display effect support added.

- Russian (& other country) coinage/tournament settings added.


CPU Release : 10.00

Date : October 28, 2005

- Fixed a bug with entering initials for Destroy the Ring Champion when it was earned during a ToPS Tournament game.

- Cleaned up some hacks related to Sound OS problems (the 9.0x releases, not in 9.00).

- Fixed a bug where Palantir might try to add-a-ball when all balls were already on the playfield during multiball.

- Fixed a bug where the game would show the FOTR MB Lit display effect AFTER you had already started it (this happened if Pippen was the last person to be collected).

- Russian (& other country) coinage/tournament settings added.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* HIDDEN BIRTHDAY/HOLIDAY MESSAGES : The birthdays of people and family members associated with the making of the game show up on the display when the game is slam tilted or power cycled. These birth dates show up only on the actual birthday.

These are the messages as they appear on the segment displays. The only way to make these appear is to slam tilt the game OR enter and then exit test mode. This isn't the way it was intended to work. When games are hooked up to a debugger the power up message does not appear so the happy birthday message would come up on power up. When a game is on a ROM the power up message comes up and prevents the happy birthday message from happening. This was never noticed until after production, so it ended up more hidden than intended.

Note : The timing between the RLRLRL is sensitive so tap consistently as you sing or it will not all come up. You must also start the second verse while the EEEIIIIEEEIIIOOO is going on or you will not see the second part. Remember, time your taps as you would if you were singing it. You can do it as many times as you like by starting from the beginning of the song once it finishes. Once you shoot the ball into play you can't do it again until the next ball (must go through full sequence again)

Get the quote 'Anyone for Peking duck?' by doing one of the following : 

Pull the trigger at the beginning of each mode (does not work on Duel of Wills and Hotel). 

Pull the trigger at the end of Duel of Wills.

The quote is also heard during the Extra Ball animation, during the quote 'I know' in Who Knows award, when you get a Scene Bonus of 2M, when the ball is in the Battle Field popper.

The quote is only heard once per playfield location.

The quote is said by 3 different people and when you´ve heard all three, start a scene to start The Secret Laughing mode (Observe the duck on the right, quacking.).


During normal play, the mist behind the score digits sometimes forms a cow or a duck. Pull the trigger to hear them!


Sometimes when you drain through an outlane, a bunch of cows walks across the screen, moo'ing.


Pull the trigger in the Video mode to clear the screen for a few seconds, but watch out when the Purba's return! This only works once per Video mode.


Pull the trigger in the Mongol Hurry Up to end the mode and award 3M.

The Simpsons Pinball Party (c) 2003 Stern Pinball.


The adventures of America's most colorful family, The Simpsons, are transformed into a wild affair in Stern Pinball's pinball machine, THE SIMPSONS PINBALL PARTY. The game features many of The Simpsons favorite characters on a two-level play-field, complete with game modes influenced by various classic Simpsons' episodes.


The object of The Simpsons Pinball Party is to  help the citizens of Springfield to party like there's no tomorrow. The game features a talking-moving Homer head  and Bart on a skateboard attached to a captive ball feature, as well as Itchy & Scratchy drop targets and Comic Book Guy. The garage door in the Simpsons' house leads to the second play-field level which features a dot matrix color television, a monorail that transports the  ball across the play-field and a couch that when filled with three pinballs starts multi-ball.

- TRIVIA -


Released in January 2003.


Simpsons' creator Matt Groening and Bongo/Fox Studios developed the artwork for The Simpsons Pinball Party. The game also features original dialog performed by the show voice actors Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria and Dan Castellaneta.


Gary Stern comments : "The Simpsons Pinball Party is  a great game with action for players of all levels. The title The Simpsons appeals to all ages, but particularly to our core 20's to 30's market.".


Keith P. Johnson, former Williams employee and software designer on The Simpsons Pinball Party says : In the last 12 years, both pinball and The Simpsons have come a long way, and it was my goal to design a game that illustrates that perfectly. Casual players will be attracted to the Simpsons license and the compelling gadgets. Regular players will be astounded by the sheer amount of  things to do and accomplish on the game. I think players of all kinds will be drawn in and find the game satisfying regardless of their skill level..

- Made Nuclear Value Award screen more informative (no one knew you could get extra balls from it).

- Extended Springfield Mystery Spot jackpot display effect times.

- All audits should be chalking properly now.

- Implemented Garage Door Difficulty adjustment. This allows the Garage Door to reopen automatically under certain circumstances as follows :

Extra Easy : Until Couch Multiball is started.

Easy : Until any couch lock is made.

Moderate : Until any couch lock or tv mode started.

Hard : Until any couch lock, tv mode started, or mystery lit.

Extra Hard : Never reopens

The default setting for this adjustment from Extra Easy install to Extra Hard install is as follows : Extra Easy; Extra Easy, Easy, Moderate, Hard.

- Implemented Hold Couch Locks adjustment. This allows the couch to hold onto balls between games and between players. The settings are :

Never : Couch always empties at game over, no locks are ever held.

1 Player Games : Couch doesn't empty at game over and anyone playing a 1-player game can steal any locked balls.

Always : Couch doesn't empty at game over, AND players can steal other players' locks.

This adjustment will be treated as Never if Competition Mode is on. During tournament games, balls will stay physically locked, but players must still make 3 locks in order to start Couch Multiball. The default setting for this adjustment from Extra Easy install to Extra Hard install is as follows : 1 Player Games, 1 Player Games, 1 Player Games, Never, Never. 

- Implemented Adult Content adjustment. When off, the following phrases are removed from the game :

Kick ass, man!

Holy crap!

Somebody check the men's room for a Hugh Jass.

- Fixed memory extra balls and specials staying lit between games.

When Bart is stuck along the way, a solid hit to the captive ball should send Bart back far enough to score one award, keeping the feature alive.


CPU RELEASE : 2.02

Date : February 19, 2003

- Sound test fixed for real now. Really.

- Hurryup value bug fixed.


CPU RELEASE : 2.03

Date : February 26, 2003

- Fixed a problem with going to the wrong menu for Dr. Pinball.

- Fixed a nasty problem with the HOLD COUCH LOCKS adjustment. If balls were in the couch at the start of a multiplayer game and this adjustment was set for 1-PLAYER GAMES, player 1 would get screwed with never being able to start Couch Multiball.

- Fixed Scratchy's Revenge being able to start during Alien Invasion. Now it is properly unable to start until after Invasion is over.

- Added 'Chaos Mode' for helping clear balls out of the VUK in very early production games.

- Fixed Alien Invasion not resetting its total.

- Fixed a problem in Alien Invasion where if a ball was locked before all the balls were autolaunched from the trough, it would not get the proper number of balls into play.

- Fixed an obscure problem in Alien Invasion where if you started it with 2 balls locked in the couch, locked one of the balls, then drained the other, it would just sit there until the mode ended.

- Added a bunch of switch compensation, more to come.


DISPLAY RELEASE : 2.01

Date : February 26, 2003

- Dr. Pinball switch test now displayed correctly


CPU RELEASE : 2.04

Date : February 28, 2003

CPU RELEASE : 2.05

Date : March 22, 2003

- THIS ROM HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED. IT IS BEING BROUGHT TO ASI 2003.

- Fixed issues related to restarting a game in progress (endless tilt, free ball save).

- Fixed Show Upper Flippers adjustment (it works now).

- Tilting before valid playfield on ball 1 now won't say The Simpsons again.

- Tilt won't reserve and plunge a drained ball if valid playfield didn't occur.

- Drop Target Hurryup now killed at Invasion start.

- Issues with Invasion stage getting confused shouldn't occur now.

- Invasion should now score correctly (1M x balls locked, not always 2M).

- Bug that prevented bonus speech from happening fixed.

- SMS flippers now work correctly if it is restarted.

- Added deff for Couch Lock Lit.

- Nuclear Disaster won/lost effects now work correctly.

- Mystery lock award labels fixed.

- Nuclear Disaster background now goes away properly when you win it.

- Lots of light shows added for SMS and Revenge.


CPU RELEASE : 2.06

Date : March 27, 2003

- default french replay level now 12M

- added replay logic to evaluate recent games to determine if the replay level should be raised/lowered or remain the same


CPU RELEASE : 2.07

Date : March 27, 2003

- removed DEVELOPMENT settings from previous release.


CPU RELEASE : 3.00

DISPLAY RELEASE : 3.00

Date : April 29, 2003

- Properly chalk wins in all tv modes now.

- Altered difficulty of Scratchy's Revenge. In order to light the first super jackpot, you now need to make 15 jackpots MINUS the number of Itchy & Scratchy multiball super jackpots earned in that cycle (the minimum number of jackpots is 5). For subsequent super jackpots in the same Revenge multiball, 15 jackpots are needed to light.

- The number of ratings points for Krusty's Last Stand that you get for shooting the right orbit has been doubled to 20. With a good spinner, this should cause the mode to be finishable in 3 shots, with a maximum of 5 shots.

- Altered difficulty of Alien Invasion. Now the time you get for completing AI is based on the number of TV modes you have WON in that cycle. The time is 45 seconds, plus 5 seconds for every mode won. If all 7 modes were won, then AI's timer starts at the maximum of 99 seconds.

- Added player-abort feature for Alien Invasion. If a ball becomes hopelessly stuck (e.g. 2 balls sneak behind the I&S drop targets), then the player may hold in the start button for 1 second. This will kick out ALL currently locked balls with no effect on the stage or the ballsaver. The player may then try again to lock all of the balls for that stage. It is recommended to abort the current stage as soon as a ball is trapped because no ballsaver will come on when kicking out the balls.

- Victory Laps now cash-in correctly when Alien Invasion starts.

- Fixed a nasty bug that would carry over the Victory Lap value across Invasion, possibly inflating Victory Laps for TV modes won on the same ball after Invasion finished.

- It is now impossible to change the Adult Content adjustment when the game is dipped for Chuck E. Cheese.

- Added Standard Adjustment 47 - Ticket Dispenser Installed. Default is NO.  When set to YES, the game will attempt to give tickets when they are set as an award type. This also disables any flipper stack switches that may be in a game (upper right flippers in the case of TSPP).

- Added Standard Adjustment 48 - Allow Player Competition. Default is YES.  When set to YES, players may activate competition-mode games by holding in the left flipper for a second. If a game can be started (i.e. there are credits on it), a countdown will show up on the display. Hitting the start button during this countdown puts the game into competition mode for that game only (but for all players of that game). See notes below for details on Competition Mode rules.

- Added Standard Adjustment 49 - Show Tech Alert. Default for now is NEVER.  This adjustment controls where/when the Tech Alert message will pop up : POWERUP shows the message after booting and before games can be started; COIN DOOR OPEN shows the message when the coin door opens up; POWERUP AND COIN DOOR for both of the above; NEVER will never show Tech Alert Alert.

- Improved some choreography for Pretzel Multiball.

- Added Pretzel Multiball Total page.


CPU Release : 4.00

Display Release : 4.00

Date : July 14, 2003

- Now properly light special during SDMEWM.

- Fixed a bug in switch dispatching that would sometimes cause a switch to either double-register or register on powerup.

- Fixed a nasty bug with Mystery awarding LIGHT LOCK in higher difficulty couch locks. If you were on a multiball that required LIGHT LOCK to be hit in order and had already completed the LIGHT portion, then got LIGHT LOCK from Mystery, you would not be able to progress towards Couch Multiball anymore. Being awarded LIGHT LOCK from Mystery will now turn off the LIGHT LOCK targets if locks are not allowed to be stacked.

- Fixed a bug where display effects would be aborted with just the right flipper instead of both flippers at the same time.

- Added a timeout for the transition of shooter groove to mainplay if for some reason the cpu is not getting the signal from the sound section.

- Added 2 display effect calls for CBG Secret Stash : CBG Secret Stash Start and the notice that all shots are relit.

- Added Feature Adjustment 36 - Allow Volume Effects. Default is YES. When set to YES, the game will increase the volume during certain events (typically multiballs). When set to NO, the volume will not be messed with. If the game volume is set to 0 (OFF), then this adjustment will be treated as set to NO.

- Fixes made to help stop Itchy & Scratchy kickout from ejecting a ball when the drop targets are raised.

Model Number : 50020

- TRIVIA -


Coming off from his huge success from "The Addams Family" pinball game (which would go on to sell over 20,000 units), Midway gave designer Pat Lawlor complete creative control over "The Twilight Zone" (based on the classic TV series), which would be described to as "the most complex pinball game ever designed".


Among its noted features include a real analog clock that tells time until a game begins (during which it will act as an event timer), a gumball machine that dispenses balls, the Powerfield (a small separate play-field where the ball is propelled by magnets rather than flippers), and the 'Powerball', a special blue ceramic ball that is lighter and faster than a normal pinball.


This game features the song, 'Twilight Zone' (performed by Golden Earring) as its theme song. Also, during the Fast Lock mode, the music used are those from Lawlor's previous games.


Quotes from older Pat Lawlor pins are heard during "Fast Lock", in reverse chronological order : 

The Addams Family : Cousin It blabbing. Hitting lock: Cousin It: "Aaaah!". 

Funhouse : "Hey, it's only pinball!". Hitting lock: Rudy: "Gulp...ptooey!". 

Whirlwind : "Return to your homes!". Hitting lock: "Do not panic". 

Earthshaker : "It's sunny drive time!". Hitting lock: "Ooh, Gimme shelter!". 

Banzai Run : "Welcome race fans!". Hitting lock: "Go for the hill!".


This game was originally supposed to be the first game to Williams / Midway's DCS Sound System, but due to time constraints, it used the Yamaha YM2151 / Harris CVSD audio board.


This game was part of WMS' SuperPin series.


15,235 units were produced.


- UPDATES -


Version 9.4CH - Changes from revision 9.2 :

- Added a new adjustment : LITZ CHEAT OK. When set to YES, this allows the player to hold in the buy-in button during game play to enable Lost in the Zone. The next shot to the Slot Machine or Piano will start a LITZ 'practice round'. The player is not able to enter intials for LITZ champ if the cheat has been performed. 

- Implemented 'Mute & Pause' mode. Pressing buy-in Button while holding a flipper will kill music and keep flipper held. Pressing buy-in again will resume regular play. This feature can be disabled by adjustment (MUTE & PAUSE OK). The game resumes automatically after 15 minutes. 

- Added a magnet ball-catching effect at the beginning of multball. This will catch the balls on the magnets if all of these conditions are in effect : 

3 magnets installed, and all 3 work 

Adjustment for the effect is ON 

0 or 1 balls in the lockup 

White ball is in the gumball machine 

- Added an adjustment that allows white ball detection during multiball (M.B. P.B. DETECT OK). With this adjustment turned ON (default) the game behaves as before. With it OFF, then the game can no longer be fooled into thinking the white ball is in play by a quick 1-2 shot into the piano and slot machine. Use of this adjustment is recommended only if all of the proximity sensors are correctly functioning. 

- Added a preset (INSTALL #pinball) for home adjustments desired by group of silly Twilight Zone owners.

- Fixed a Powerball/Multiball bug where the Powerball was not detected when it was the 2nd ball served from the trough for Multiball start. 

- Fixed Super Skill Shot bug where a completely missed shot would end the ball and give Super Skill Shot to the next player up. 

- Added ball search to the ball recycling at the end of Lost in the Zone. 

- Enhanced the ball-type detection logic on the magnets. 

- Fixed a bug with Bonus X lamp after Bonus X awarded. 

- Added/enhanced a few lamp effects. 

- Improved the grace period logic at the end of Battle the Power timeout. 

- Added a grace period timer for the end of multiball that indicates the Powerball was in play. This enables Powerball jackpots during the jackpot grace period. 

- Added code in attract mode to page through the a-mode pages by using a flipper button.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


During the Attract Mode, press the following flipper buttons in order to see the names of the Twilight Zone design team : 5R, 1L, 1R, 1L, 5R, 1L.

Victory was the first game to use a fully screened photo realistic 'Vitrigraph' mylar overlay for it's playfield rather than the industry standard silkscreen on the wood itself. The 'Vitrigraph' mylar had significant adhesion problems; a later limited run of replacement playfields were made for operator replacement in the field. These were done as a standard silkscreen on the wood, with an overlay of clear mylar.

O'Connor stated he designed the artwork for this game, delivered to him as a white-wood, because he was reading Frans Gunner Bengtsson's 'The Long Ships' at the time. The back-glass is O'Connor's vision of King Harald's Christmas feast.

Commercial Version L-5 : This is the latest commercial version of the White Water software.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


It's commonly said that all one has to do to get high scores on Whitewater is shoot whatever is lit or flashing at the time. Although this is true to a certain extent, some planning and strategy will invariably yield more consistent and higher scores.


Note that the Jackpot Value in Multiball is based on your current Raft

number, and that later Multiballs are harder to start (because Locks become

more difficult to light). Therefore, you should probably avoid Multiball for a while, and concentrate instead on Whirlpool Awards and collecting lit

Hazards. Since Whirlpool Challenge is the first Whirlpool Award, you should start there.


There are 2 strategies for maximum points in Whirlpool Challenge, and they are dependent on proper behavior of the Lost Mine kickout. You should be able to either dead-catch the ball on the right flipper, or hold the right flipper up and let the ball roll up into the Right Inlane (in which case you should adjust the lit lane accordingly in order to collect one or two free R-I-V-E-R letters). One strategy is to keep both balls in play, constantly hitting No Way Out and then the Whirlpool, paying attention to the sound effects in order to know where the next ball will be coming. The sound effect for a ball being fed from No Way Out to the Upper Playfield is a shrill sound taken directly from Comet. The other strategy requires catching one ball on the left flipper at some point. You can then hold that ball while repeatedly hitting No Way Out and the Whirlpool, then catching the ball from the Lost Mine and repeating the sequence until you slip up.


It may help to nudge the machine forward as the ball is being kicked out of the Lost Mine in order to make it land fairly. If the kickout is irregular or too powerful, advise your operator (good luck).


It is somewhat dangerous to shoot the Lost Mine for Gold Rush or the Hotfoot targets for Bigfoot Hotfoot, but with enough play time, you will eventually start these sequences more or less by accident. Hotfoot is especially nice during 5X Playfield, so keep an eye on how close you are to getting it.


The Extra Ball target is extremely difficult to hit, and dangerous besides. One degree of insurance when going for this target is to start any Multiball (regular, Whirlpool Challenge, or Gold Rush) and risk draining one ball by shooting for it. The hardest part is regaining control of the ball after shooting this target.


There are at least seven strategies for actually attempting to hit the Extra Ball target (as opposed to hoping the ball will wander up there). You can straight shoot it from the left flipper. You can backhand it from the right flipper as the ball is kicked out from the Lost Mine. You can hold the right flipper up as the ball is fed from the Upper Playfield to the Right Inlane, letting it roll over to the tip of the left flipper, where it may (should) be in the perfect position for straight shooting the target. You can nudge the machine forward as the ball is bouncing at the top of the right slingshot; this can often push the ball right up into the Extra Ball target. You can nudge the machine as the ball is hit by the left slingshot, which may kick the ball across to the target. You can catch the ball on the right flipper, twitch the flipper so that the ball rolls up the inlane slightly and then down to the middle of the flipper, from where you can neatly backhand the target. You can also shoot the ball from the very tip of the left flipper, up the Right Inlane and into the Extra Ball target. This is tricky and rarely works, but it sure does look cool.


At the beginning of Multiball, ignore balls that have already successfully come down Insanity Falls. Concentrate on getting the second and third balls up Insanity Falls to earn Double and Triple Jackpots. You'll be very sorry if you settle for regular Jackpots, and end up hitting thirty of them during that Multiball. You will almost certainly lose the first ball if you concentrate on getting the Triple Jackpot. It may help to hold the left flipper up - the lower right flipper will be active because you're shooting Insanity Falls, and this may knock the first two balls up into play. The number of balls currently in play (two or three) does not affect your Jackpot value in any way.


If you miss the first or second shot at Insanity Falls, let that ball go. You have almost no chance of getting it up Insanity Falls, and it will be in the way of the second and/or third balls coming from No Way Out. Also, if you let the first ball go and shoot it immediately into No Way Out, the game may decide that one of its No Way Out kickouts failed, and you will get a fourth attempt at increasing the Jackpot Value. This also means that if No Way Out is a lit Hazard and you hit it from below when the game is kicking a ball out above, it may decide that it was merely a failed kickout, and you will not be awarded that Hazard.


Hitting Insanity Falls or Bigfoot Bluff is best done with a solid slap on the flipper. Without that extra bit of force, the sweet spot, especially for Insanity Falls, is extremely narrow. If you get warnings from shooting Insanity Falls (assuming you aren't actually moving the machine), your machine is set too sensitively. Complain.


Keep an eye on how many Disaster Drops you have collected. There is an Extra Ball between 3 and 15, and it's also useful for spotting the more difficult Hazards such as the Spine Chiller and Boomerang Bend, and for advancing one of the last (difficult) Rafts.


Note that Man Overboard applies to the Hazards which are already lit. Therefore, it's best to collect this when relatively easy Hazards are lit. You can also spot a Hazard and this will award the Man Overboard value.


Beware that a solid shot at No Way Out, particularly backhanded from the left flipper, may rattle around and slowly drift back out. Wait for the sound effects or graphics before you back off from the machine after locking a ball. If the ball does rattle around and drop back down, it should come to the tip of the left flipper. A careful shot will put it gently back into No Way Out as originally intended.


Beware that a very fast shot at Disaster Drop may jam against the Hazard sensor and come back around the loop, usually right towards the center drain. This baffles me, but it does happen occasionally. It usually helps to shake the machine a bit from side to side if you know the ball is coming back down Disaster Drop, so you can avoid the center drain. A small side to side or forward nudge also helps as the ball comes out of Disaster Drop after completing it succesfully - this helps keep the ball off of the left slingshot, so you can maintain control and shoot Disaster Drop again if you wish.


You can also shoot Disaster Drop from either flipper. A careful shot from the right flipper has the added advantage that the ball may brush one or more of the Lite Bounceback targets.


There are certain situations where the game will kick out a locked ball from No Way Out even though there is a ball available for the plunger lane. Specifically, if you lock a ball and there is already one more locked from another player than you have locked, it will kick out a locked ball in order to bring your Locks in line with the other players' Locks. For Whirlpool Challenge, you will always receive the ball at the plunger lane if one is available. Otherwise, the Lost Mine kickout usually fires first, before the No Way Out kickout (rather unfair).


Note that, depending on your difficulty settings and the skill of the average player on your machine, the Bigfoot's Cave sensor, which is only reachable during Bigfoot Hotfoot, may often remain untriggered for 90 balls, which causes the machine to assume that the sensor may be faulty. This is the most common cause of a '.' being displayed after 'Credits' or 'Free Play' on Whitewater machines, and it can obscure anything else that might be wrong with the machine.


If the Bigfoot's Cave sensor has been judged out-of-order by the machine, the rules are adjusted, and you are awarded a Bigfoot Jackpot for shooting Bigfoot Bluff during Hotfoot, before the ball reaches the Bigfoot's Cave sensor. This means that if the sensor is in fact working, you will receive credit for two Bigfoot Jackpots the first time you hit it. The game will then re-adjust its rules to normal.


The most important shot in the game is No Way Out. You need to be able to hit this shot from either flipper at almost any time, and often you will benefit from hitting it without even looking at the ball (ie, during Multiball when you're concentrating on shooting Jackpots on the Upper Playfield). The next most important shot would be Insanity Falls. The Bigfoot Bluff shot is actually rather easy.


Note that the value of the Vacation Bonus is easily overshadowed by the Double and Triple Jackpots in the ensuing Multiball, which will be at least 60M and 90M, respectively. But you definitely shouldn't pass up the Vacation Bonus - it's too cool to be missed.


5X Playfield may actually be somewhat wasted on Multiball under the correct scoring rules. It's especially nice to have 5X Playfield during Wet Willie's. Otherwise, try to collect it when you have only one Hazard remaining to advance to a high Raft number. This can be worth as much as 100M (for reaching, but not for starting, Wet Willie's).


If you want to attempt to get a 5X Vacation Bonus, you must reach and complete Wet Willie's, the entire Boulder Garden, and reach River Class Six. Your best chance comes when you have Bigfoot Bluff lit for the 5X Playfield Whirlpool Award, two balls locked, and the third Lock already lit for the Vacation Bonus. At this point, you have two ways of getting the ball to the Upper Playfield to start 5X Playfield. One is to shoot the Spine Chiller - this is a bit risky, since it is a difficult shot and in your attempt to regain control of a missed shot, you may accidentally collect the Vacation Bonus by hitting No Way Out. The other alternative is to let the current ball drain! On the next ball (assuming you have one ;), plunge the ball to the Upper Playfield and collect 5X Playfield.  Catch the kickout from the Lost Mine... and shoot for a 5X Vacation Bonus. Note that this does NOT award 1B on L-3 ROMs, but on older ROMs, anything is possible.


There is an 'Insanity Record' maintained, representing the person who hit Insanity Falls (lit or unlit) the most times over the course of a single game. It isn't worth anything remarkable except to have your initials there. The only way to know how many 'Waterfalls' you've collected is to hit the unlit Insanity Falls and see it as part of the graphics.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Playfield Layout :

Kickback : Left outlane has a kickback. Kickback is relit by passing through the right inlane, which lights the Light Kickback target for 5 seconds, then hitting the light kickback target before it times out. Note that the goal/striker scoop and Skill shot feed the right inlane.


Magna-Save : The Magna-Save is just above the tip of the left flipper, and is set to save a straight-down-the-middle drain. By hitting an extra button next to the left flipper button, you activate the Magna-Save which pulls the ball into place above your left flipper so you can catch it. When the magna-save is not lit, the left inlane lights the magna-save target on the right, just above the slingshots, for 5 seconds; hit it before it times out to relight the magna save.


Left Orbit/Spinner : When a city is lit, the spinner scores the city and sends the ball all the way around and shooting out the right-hand side. Otherwise the ball is diverted into the roll-overs. May be lit for ultra-spinner or build soccer ball.


Left Ramp : A diverter sends the ball either to the right flipper, pop bumpers, or left habitrail. The left habitrail locks the ball if lock is lit, otherwise returns the ball to the left flipper. When the diverter sends the ball to the right, a soft shot lands in the pop-bumpers, while a harder shot goes to the right flipper. The ramp may be lit for ultra-ramps, build soccer ball, re-light jackpot, collect half-ticket, and lock ball.


Striker Targets : Striker is the mascot of World Cup Soccer '94, and he has three stand-up targets on the game. One on each side of the left ramp, and one in front of the jet bumpers at the upper right. Hitting a Striker target spots a letter in the word STRIKER. Spell STRIKER to score 10M and light the Striker scoop. Note that hitting the goaltender also spots a letter in STRIKER. Hitting the upper right Striker target also spots a Star Rollover.


Light Free Kick : Two saucers, one on middle left and other on middle right of playfield. Falling in it lights the Free Kick stand-up target for 10 seconds.


Tackles : This is a row of three stand-up targets. Scores 10M when lit.


Assist : Another saucer, at the upper left, just in front of the goal. When the ball falls into the Assist saucer your goal lites and you can shoot the ball into the goal by hitting either flipper. If goal was already lit when you landed in the saucer, you score 2 Goals, otherwise score just 1 goal.


Star Rollovers : There are four rollovers leading towards the goal. Light a rollover by rolling over it. Light all four and goal is lit.


GOAL! : At the upper center of the playfield there is a goal, with a goalie who moves back and forth. You shoot the ball past the goalie and into the goal. Each goal starts an Ultra Mode. Score 4 Goals to light the next TV award. Goals are also used to establish rank for the first multiball (Section 5) and as the jackpot in multiball.


Striker Scoop : Scoop in the back middle of the playfield, to the right of the goal. Hitting it when lit serves up a random Striker Award. Also collect Extra Balls here.


Rollover Lanes : Lighting both lanes flashes the next city. 


Jet Bumpers : During normal play, the jets are worth 1OOK a pop and add one thousand fans for each pop. At 25,OOO fans, the jet value becomes 1M / pop for the rest of the ball.


Soccer Ball : Spins whenever goal is lit. No points for hitting it.


Free Kick Target : When lit from one of the Free Kick saucers, this target awards 10M. Also used in Super Free Kick Striker Award.


TV Award / Final Draw scoop : When lit for TV award, this gives out a TV Award (Section 3). Also serves to start multiball when lit for Final Draw. If TV and Multiball lit, multiball has precedence.


Right Ramp: Always feeds the left flipper or rollover lanes for a soft 

shot. Can be lit for all the same things as left ramp.


Right Outlane : There is a special light here, which is lit after defeating Germany in Multiball.


Plunger / Skill Shot : This game has a manual plunger. Hit a flashing slot to score 5M, 10M, or 30M, depending on whether there are 3, 2, or 1 slots flashing respectively. When you hit the last flashing one you also spot a city and reset all slots to flashing for next time.


* Ultra Modes : After each goal, you are awarded an 'Ultra' mode. There are four Ultra modes, and each one lasts for the length of your ball or until you score 30M on the mode, at which time you are given a 10M bonus and the mode ends. The modes you currently have lit are indicated by four lightning bolt-shaped lights on the right side of the playfield. These modes do not add to your score during the normal game, they are only used for fun with bonus.


The 4 ultra modes are the following :

Utlra Ramps : About what it says. Shoot ramps for 5M per ramp.

Utlra Spinner : Ditto, to the tune of 1M a spin.

Ultra Jets : This is a pop bumper bonus. Pop bumpers are upped to 2M a pop.

Utlra Goalie : Nail the goalie! One of two Hit the Goalie modes, these are completely hilarious. Hitting the goalie scores 5Ma shot.


End-of-ball is awarded as 5M per goal and 5M per city obtained so far in the game, and the total of your Ultra Modes on that ball.


* TV Awards : The TV (center scoop) starts the game lit, and every four goals relight it. The TV awards are stackable, which means it can be lit for more than one award. Shoot the center scoop to start the timed TV Award mode (these were 20 or 25 seconds) for bonus scoring. Starting any TV Award is worth a cool 25M. 


There are 4 TV awards, always awarded in the following order :

Big Goal Round : Shoot three goals within the time limit for 15M, 15M and 30M.

Extra Ball Round : Extra Ball lit for 20 seconds. If you hit the extra ball, then the Striker scoop is worth 50M for the rest of the time limit.

Hit The Goalie! : Same as above except timed. Hitting the goalie is worth 10M, shooting the goal raises the goalie value by 10M. Still totally great.

Where's Striker : Shoot any of the dog targets to try and find Striker. First hit finds somebody (watch the display to see who!) and scores low points. The second finds somebody else and scores medium points. The third hit finds Striker and scores big points.


* Striker Awards : Hitting a Striker target or the goalie scores 1M and adds a letter to the word STRIKER. Spelling STRIKER awards 10M and lights the Striker scoop. It is also lit at the start of the game. 

Shoot the Striker scoop to collect a random award. The first Striker award may also be collected from the goal if the goal is not lit. In normal play, awards are random. In tournament play, awards are always given in the same order, with the Penalty Kick being the first one.

The possible Striker Awards are the following :

Extra Ball : Guess.

Multiball : Starts multiball. This award is only (and always) awarded on ball 3 if you have not yet had multiball in that game. The award starts you off at a very low jackpot value, so it is not the preferable way to start multiball.

20 million : Another toughie.

Super Free Kick : Makes the free kick target worth 10M + 5M per hit for about 45 to 60 seconds.

Penalty Kick : Gives you a shot at the goal with the goalie not moving and leaning out of the way. hit the goal for 30M.

Advance Three Cities : Gives you your next three cities, regardless of whether or not they are already flashing.

Unlimited Kickback : Kickback lit for the rest of the ball!

3 Goals : Adds 3 goals to your total, and start 3 ultra rounds.


* Multiball : The left spiral, left ramp, right ramp and Striker scoop have arrows labeled BUILD in front of them. When flashing, shoot it to light one of the words Strength, Stamina, Skill, Speed and Spirit to the soccer ball drawn on the playfield. Light all five to light lock. Shoot either ramp to lock the ball and light Final Draw scoop to start multiball. 

Start multiball by shooting final draw. You start multiball at a certain rank. For the first multiball, your rank is determined as follows :

Every 2 goals advances you 1 rank, and if you start multiball from the Final Draw scoop instead of via a striker award you advance 4 ranks. You beat a team by shooting the goal (this is your jackpot,) and then get to play the next team by shooting a ramp (relighting jackpot.) There are fifteen teams, with the following ranks and jackpot values :

15 USA 20M

14 Russia 20M

13 South Korea 25M

12 Saudi Arabia 30M

11 Morocco 35M

10 Austria 40M

9 Canada 45M

8 Holland 50M

7 Italy 55M

6 Great Britain 60M

5 Sweden 65M

4 Spain 65M

3 Australia 75M

2 France 100M

1 Germany 250M


If you drain before hitting a jackpot, shooting a ramp or the Final Draw scoop will restart multiball where you left off. In subsequent multiballs, your initial rank is 2 places higher than the last team defeated in the previous multiball.


If you defeat #1 Germany, you score 250M, the Special is lit at the right outlane, and the ramps and goal are lit as Victory Laps worth 50M a piece. After five laps, the Victory Laps then alternate between left ramp and goal. On subsequent multiballs, you start with #2 Germany (because you are now #1), and if you defeat Germany again, you get another 250M and go into the victory lap. The only difference this time is that the Special does not light up.


The Assist saucer works during multiball, but best of all, its programmed not to miss, and automatically relights the GOAL for the next jackpot (even if you did not relight it via a ramp).


* Cities : There are 9 cities on the World cup tour : Chicago, Dallas, Boston, 

New York, Orlando, Washington DC, San Francisco, Detroit and LA. An unlit city means you do not yet have a ticket. A city that is flashing means you have a ticket, which was obtained by shooting both ramps or collecting both rollovers. Travel to a city by shooting the spinner.

A city may be spotted by completing all three flashing shots on the skill shot. If the city was already flashing, then it makes the next unlit city flashing. The Striker Award may also award advance 3 cities, which marks the next three cities as travelled (regardless of whether they were flashing or not lit).

Travelling to Chicago, Dallas and Boston score 10M each. New York, Orlando and Washington score 15M. others score 20M. Travelling to any city also lights the Tackle target. 

The following cities also have awards associated with them :

Boston : Boston Tea Party : A hurry up mode : starts at 40M and counts down to 10M. Shoot spinner to collect.

Washington D.C. : Lights Extra Ball

Los Angeles. : World Cup Final : After travelling to Los Angeles, shoot the Final Draw hole to start the Final Match against Germany. Five ball timed multiball against Germany for 45 seconds. You must plunge the balls yourself and goals are worth 75M. Every once in a while Germany will score a goal. If you end the 45 seconds with more goals than Germany you get a bonus of 500M. If you end in a tie, overtime is started and the first team to score a goal wins. The first time you reach the world cup final, Germany will score about 3 to 5 goals. The second time, Germany may score as many as 7 or 8 goals.


* Known Problem in World Cup Final : In the world cup final, if you shoot too many goals at a time (e.g. you have two or three balls in the goal at once) only one of them will register. This is due to the design of the goal and the placement of the sensor. Should this happen during tournament play, then tough, you lose out on those points. Best thing to do is not shoot the goal for 2 or 3 seconds, and let the machine clear out all the balls from the goal, then start shooting it again.


* Tournament Settings : No extra balls. TV award extra ball round scores 50M. Striker Scoop awards always in same order, with Penalty Kick the first one.


* Scoring Level : Grand Champion scores on WCS typically range between 3B and 6B. In tournament mode, it is expected that the top A division player may score about 1B to 2B, and the average game be on the order of 300M-500M. In the B and lower divisions, top scores will probably be about 800M-1B, with an average score around 200M.
