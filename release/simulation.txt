PinMAME Simulation
------------------

The ball simulator can handle up to 7 balls in the machine. The simulator
ensures that the correct switches are activated depending on where the
balls are.

You can change the location of the simulated balls with the keyboard.
Example: Pressing LCTRL+R will send the ball up the left ramp activating
the switches associated with a complete ramp shot.
The simulator will also keep track on diverters, gates and other solenoids
to ensure that the ball ends up in the correct place.

Normally the simulator prevents impossible combinations (e.g. a ball in
the trough making a left ramp shot or a "dirty pool" in TAF). This can be
overridden by pressing the "Ignore Ball Location" button (Alt).

The general simulation keys are:

Up	Move cursor to Prevoius ball in the simulator
Down	Move cursor to Next ball in the simulator
Alt	Ignore ball location in simulator
Del     Toggle between simulator keys and switch keys.
Space   Shoot ball. If the game uses a manual shooter a bar will
        indicate the strength.

General simulator settings in the DIP switch menu:

Balls   Select 0 to 7 balls. Note that most games will be confused with
        the wrong number of balls (especially if too many).
Spinner Set the time a spinner "spinns" after a hit (not used in existing
        simulators yet)

Keys for all simulators:
'+' means that the key must be pressed with Left or Right CTRL key.
'Left Ctrl' + 'R' means Left Ramp, 'Right Ctrl' + 'S' means Right Spiral)

Game specifics
--------------------

Twilight Zone(TZ)
-----------------
DIP settings:
Third Magnet  - Activate third magnet switch and trap balls on magnet
Clock Passage - Activate clock passage opto
Big Kick      - Activate big kick opto (not implemented)

I don't know which ROM versions utilises which switches.

Known Bugs:
1. The balls doesn't always stop on the magnets. Probably some bad timing
   in the simulator.
2. The simulated clock got a digital display :-)
 
Dr. Dude (DD)
-------------
DD is orginally a System 11 game but a few of them were built using
WPC hardware. This means that the game uses the coin door switches
in a different way and that the checksum can not be disabled (game will
not start if trying)

Dr. Who (DW)
------------
DW is different from the other WPC games in that it has more power on
tests. Examples are that DW performes a very detailed testing of the WPC chip
and also uses a switch (82) to detect the playfield glass.
Use the manual switch keys ('I' + 'S') to activate/deactivate the
playfield glass switch.

Cirqus Voltaire (CV)
--------------------
On startup CV will test the ringmaster and it will not go into attract mode
if the test fails. One way to bypass it is to disable the ringmaster
(adjustment A2 30).
