Rom Aliasing
------------

To allow improved romset revision handling in PinMAME now and in the future, the following romsets
need to be renamed to allow future romsets for these games to be supported. This list may grow in
the future. The included romupd.bat file will copy any romsets it finds on this list to the
new name for you. That way you will have the old romset name as well as the new name..
Visual PinMAME will automatically alias the romsets, so you can still refer to the property
Controller.cGameName = "batmn", and it will internally convert it to "btmn_101". This will keep
backward compatibility for VPM.
