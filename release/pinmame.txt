What is it?
-----------
  PinMAME emulates the hardware found in almost every solid state pinball machine created from
  the mid 1970's through 2005. Currently, the following pinball hardware is emulated:

  Williams/Bally WPC, Williams/Bally System 11, Williams System 9, Williams System 7,
  Williams System 6, Williams System 4, Williams System 3,
  Data East AlphaNumeric System, Data East 128x16 DMD, Data East 128x32 DMD,
  Data East/Sega 192x64 DMD, Sega/Stern Whitestar System, Stern MPU-100, Stern MPU-200,
  Bally MPU-17 & MPU-35, Bally Video/Pinball, Bally 6803,
  Gottlieb System 1, 80, 80a, 80b, System 3, Hankin, Gameplan MPU-1 & MPU-2, Atari,
  Zaccaria, Taito of Brazil, Midway, Capcom, Alvin G. and Co., Technoplay, Mr.Game, Spinball,
  Nuova Bell, Inder, Juegos Populares, LTD, Peyper, Sonic, Sleic, Playmatic, NSM, Jac van Ham,
  Videodens, Micropin, Christian Tabart.

  *Note: Emulation is not 100% working on all hardware.

  PinMAME is built as an add-on to the MAME 0.76 Source Code.
  Some of the original code was altered, and fixes from later MAME versions were applied.

  All the MAME readme file with all disclaimers, credits and instructions are included for
  info on using MAME related functions.

  All standard MAME "functions" work in PinMAME (profiler, debugger, cheats,
  record/playback, command line switches etc.)

What does it do?
----------------
  Before you start to extract the ROMS from your favorite pinball machine please note:

  The PinMAME pinball emulator/simulator is not 100% playable. It only emulates the
  electronic circuit boards and the display in the pinball machine backbox.
  There is no playfield and no balls that you will see displayed!

  However, you can activate switches with you keyboard, see display animations,
  and listen/record the pinball game sounds.

  Supported means that the game loads and the display starts up with lamps etc. All games
  enter attract mode and you can use the Coin Door switches to enter the menus.

    *Note: Sound is not supported, or may not work properly for all games.
   **Note: A FEW games may not work or be supported due to customization of the original hardware
  ***Note: Some games may not be supported simply because we could not find full rom sets.

Simulated?
----------
  For many games there is a ball simulator which you can use to simulate "playing" the game.
  The simulator allows you to use the keyboard to make shots/hit targets with your virtual/
  invisible pinball..

  Essentially, it triggers the correct switches depending on where the balls are located.

  (You can program a simulator for your own favourite game if you know a
  bit of programming and a lot about the game. If you are intersted let us know and we'll
  try to explain how to do it)

  For more information, please refer to simulation.txt for instructions on using the pinball
  simulator built into pinmame!

  *NEW*: Many games not fully simulated, now have preliminary simulator support!


Instructions
-------------
  Only PinMAME specific setting are listed here. Please read the MAME readme
  file for instructions on using mame and all it's options.

  Note: The ROMS downloaded *directly* from William's website may be compressed with a zip
  version not supported by mame.

  If they do not work for you, you will need to uncompress them (using pkzip or Winzip for example),
  and recompress them using the "normal compression" setting!

  Roms available from other websites should work fine!

  Some ROM images are double size (i.e. the data appears twice).
  This is most often done on purpose due to the limited availability
  of smaller sized EPROMS or to simplify upgrades (all ROM images same size).
  PinMAME accepts the double sized ROMs but the checksum verification
  is disabled. The -verifyroms will still report wrong sized ROMs.


Command line switches
---------------------
  These options can be set on the command line or in mame.cfg:

  -[no]dmd_compact   off = Display a more DMD like display (space between dots)
                     on  = Display a compact DMD display

  -[no]dmd_only      off = Display lamps, swithes and simulator
                     on  = Don't display lamps, switches and simulator
                           (they still work). Good when creating animations
                           or screen shots!

  -[no]cheat         on  = Speed up WPC game start up by disabling checksum
                           (does not work with Dr. Dude). Try it on a security
                           PIC game for an interesting message. The
                           functionality is present in the roms, PinMAME just
                           enables it.
                           Also enables MAME cheats (e.g overclocking)
                     off = Normal startup

  -dmd_antialias n   Antialias the DMD display with intensity 0-100%.

Other MAME settings (modified to work with PinMAME)
---------------------------------------------------
  - The display looks better with -noscanlines
  - Display must be forced to 8 bit (-depth 8) if it is not doing so automatically.
  - Printer output will be saved in the MEMCARD directory
  - You may underclock the DCS sound CPU to increase performance but
    sound will be slightly delayed (not synchronized with the display)
    and will sometimes be garbled. Use F8,F9,F11 keys for underclocking.
  - DCS GAMES: Use -samplerate 32000 for the most accurate sound reproduction

PinMAME Specific Command line switches
--------------------------------------
  The following are new command line switches for PinMAME only, and do not
  exist in MAME.

  These can be set on the command line or in mame.cfg

  -dmd_red   0-255 (Controls the amount of red displayed for a DMD Dot when
                    it's lit at 100%!)
  -dmd_green 0-255 (Controls the amount of green displayed for a DMD Dot when
                    it's lit at 100%!)
  -dmd_blue  0-255 (Controls the amount of blue displayed for a DMD Dot when
                    it's lit at 100%!)
  -dmd_perc66 0-100 (Sets the Percentage to display a DMD Dot which is lit
                    at 66%, Default = 67%)
  -dmd_perc33 0-100 (Sets the Percentage to display a DMD Dot which is lit
                    at 33%, Default = 34%)
  -dmd_perc0  0-100 (Sets the Percentage to display a DMD Dot when NOT lit.
  -dmd_antialias 0-100 (sets the dmd antialiasing intensity)
  -dmd_only         (don't display lamp/switch/solenoid matrices)
  -dmd_compact      (display dmd and led displays in a more compact format)
  (for more information on the settings above, see "Changing the Look of the DMD")


General Keys
------------
  Each Hardware platform supports different keys. See Keys.txt for more info.

Controlling switches (manually)
-------------------------------

  The following keys will toggle the state of a switch

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  ---------------
  Q,W,E,R,T,Y,U,I Select Column 1-8
  A,S,D,F,G,H,J,K Select Row    1-8

  For example, to toggle switch 34 (Col 3, Row 4) press E while holding F!
  If the game has a simulator, press "Del" key to toggle between simulator keys
  and the switch keys.


DIP settings
-------------
  You can change the country and other settings for the game in the DIP menu.
  All games does not support all country settings.

  Each game and the simulator can use some "fake" DIP settings to
  choose between different hardware options (e.g. number of balls installed).

Display
-------
  The display shows the DMD or the Alphanumeric LEDs and optionally
  (via the -[no]dmd_only command line option) three matrices:

  Top:      Lamp Matrix
  Middle:   Switche Matrix
  Bottom:   Solenoids/Flasher Matrix
  Below:    Diagnostic Lights found on the main hardware board.

  PinMAME contains functionality to diplay the lamp matrix laid out similar
  to the real pinball machine. See TZ for an example.

  If you want to do a similar layout for you favorite game which does not
  yet exist, let us know.

Changing the Look of the DMD
----------------------------

 Changing Color:

   Every dot in the DMD uses an RGB(red, green, blue) color triplet to specify
   the color of each dot to display. To change colors properly, you must know
   the appropriate RGB numbers of the color you wish to use.

   For example, PinMAME's default is a yellowish color: Red = 255, Green = 224,
   Blue = 32
   For an orange color, you could use: Red = 255, Green = 64, Blue = 0
   For red dots, you could use: Red = 255, Green = 0, Blue = 0

   Experiment with the #'s, until you find colors that look good to you!

 Changing the Intensity of the DMD Dots:

   The DMD uses 3 levels of intensity (100%,66%,33%) plus an "unlit" state
   to create graphics on the display. 100% are dots that are fully lit,
   where as 66%, 33%, 0% will each be darker than the fully lit dot,
   by a certain percentage.

   You can control these percentages yourself to change the appearance
   of the DMD. You can change the intensities, using dmd_perc66, dmd_perc33
   and dmd_perc0. You cannot change a fully lit dot's intensity. It must
   always be 100%.

   For example, to make the DMD Dots much closer in intensity, you could adjust
   the settings to (100%,90%,80%), by setting dmd_perc66 = 90, dmd_perc33 = 80.
   This would result in animations where the contrast between each of the 3
   intensity levels would be minimal.

   To make the contrast even more drastic, you could use (100%,50%,20%),
   by setting dmd_perc66 = 50, dmd_perc33 = 20.

   These are just examples to demonstrate the functionality. Using these
   #'s, would probably not look very good! :)

   As with the Colors, experiment with the intensity levels, until you find
   #'s that look good to you!


Sound Command Mode
------------------

  PinMAME has the ability to let you trigger sound commands manually. This
  will let you play any sound the pinball game can make. Hit the F4 key to
  turn Sound Command Mode on or off. Follow the instructions on screen to
  generate sounds.

  The sound commander work in two modes:
  Manual mode:  you enter the commands directly using the arrows.
                NOTE: Not all Sound Command #'s generate a sound. e.g.
                Many games don't have a sound for command #01!
                Most games require two bytes for each command.

  Command mode: Sound command are read from the "sounds.dat" file
                and you can scroll thru all available commands
                with the arrow keys. Look in the sounds.dat for
                details on hw to use it.

  For some games the sound command history is displayed. It can be useful
  to find out how certain sound are generated.

Recording Sounds to a Wave File
-------------------------------

  PinMAME can record the sound output to a wave file for you to play back
  anytime you want. Hit the F5 key to begin recording, and hit F5 again,
  to stop recording.
  The files are created in the wave directory. They begin with the name
  of the game, plus a #, just like screenshots work.

  If you're having trouble make sure your .cfg file points to a valid directory,
  and that you have enough free disk space to create the wave.

  Important:
  ----------

  WAV files can become *very* big quickly. These are not compressed like
  MP3 files, so be carefull. You can easily end up with 50MB wav files
  for just a few minutes of recording!

Accessing Williams/Bally WPC - Hidden Menu
------------------------------------------

  Did you know that all WPC Machines have a hidden menu?
  Yes, it's true. To access it, you must leave the bookkeeping menu while
  holding down 'up' [9] and 'down' [8] buttons. i.e. press 'Enter' [0] three
  times, so that "B1. Main Audits" is flashing as the selected choice
  Now hold down 'up' [9] and 'down' [8] and press 'escape' [7].
  If you did it correctly, you should see a new choice on the menu:
  EXEC LOCKUPS - B.1 01..... Using the normal Up/Down keys you can cycle through
  the other new choices...Try this on your real machine at home too!
