Version 2.6 (December 24, 2015) - "The team awakens"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three and a half years have gone by since the last release.
We kept everybody happy by putting out beta versions now and then,
but now we felt the time was right to issue a new version.

This time, Visual PinMAME will also be bundled with the new VP10 in one installer package
in order to reduce the amount of inherent knowledge needed to create a working playable setup.

Have fun, and Merry Christmas everyone! :)

With help from Matt Elder and Basillo Garcia, we managed to get working roms for Inder Metal Man and Spinball's last game - Verne's World.

Version 2.4 (August 19, 2011) - "Summertime"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eight months is a long time to go without a release, but we wanted to make some significant progress
with plenty of testing, so it's here now.  We thought the rom fountain had run dry, but then
Seymour Shabow mentioned he had worked on free play roms, Micko alerted us to alternate Stern roms,
David Gersic posted his modified Zaccaria Free Play roms, and Inkochnito told us we were missing a lot
of roms from Oliver Okaegi... so...a whole lot of typing was required to add support for all of these!

One of our goals is to archive all pinball game code, as well as code that runs on pinball hardware.
If you think you have code we don't support, please let one of us know.

Version 2.3 (December 24, 2010) - "Merry Christmas"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And here we are again at the end of another year for PinMAME; time flies!

And it was a good year for pinball and pinball emulation in particular:
Maddes moved the code repository from CVS to SVN on SourceForge,
and Randall Perlow joined the crew to work on the Micropin emulation,
which was perfect because he owns the real thing as well! :)

Also, there are finally some good reads for Astro's "Black Sheep Squadron"
(thanks to Dave from Alltek Systems), something I didn't believe I'd ever
see in my lifetime. The game is not that great actually, but we were hunting
for a good set of ROMs for like 10 years... ;)

Also: Brian got the speech ROM for "Caribbean Cruise" from Steve Young,
the missing DMD ROM for "Aaron Spelling" from Mike Pacak,
and built in support for Ed Cheung's WPC "ghosting" patch ROMs, which
should make for a clearer look in our emulated version too.

Last but not least we found a sound ROM revision for Williams Space Shuttle
that corrects a bug in the previously known U49 dump which was provided by
WMS themselves! We're pretty sure that this ROM was patched by WMS themselves,
and probably used for most production games, only it apparently never made it
into WMS' official ROM database!

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Added support for Micropin Pentacup [Randall Perlow]
Added dumpframes support to export DMD data to text file [Thanks to Toxie and Highrise]
 (disabled by default, change DUMPFRAMES to 1 in core.c and rebuild to enable)
Added preliminary support for Stargame Mephisto (not working at all right now)
Added Christian Tabart sound support [Gerrit Volkenborn]
Added debugger option to access the internal RAM of I8039 CPU family [Gerrit Volkenborn]

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Loads of new dumps here and there (see above for examples)
Williams Funhouse 9.05H and some other WMS clones
Bell: Super Bowl (based on Bally's X's & O's)
Taito: Ice Cold Beer (a non-pinball skill game)
Christian Tabart: L'Hexagone, using Gottlieb "Genie" ROM but adding a modern sound board
 (thanks to Michel Achille, designer of that very board!)
Jac Van Ham: Movie Masters (sound ROM not dumped yet)
Juegos Populares: Olympus (sound ROMs only)
Micropin: Pentacup
Peyper: Wolf Man
Support for more Playmatic games (thanks to Basilio Garcia and Paulo Branco)
- Big Town / Party (those use the same ROMs as Last Lap)
- Antar (alternate set)
- Attack
- Black Fever
- Cerberus
- Rock 2500
- Spain '82
- Star Fire
- Trailer
- UFO-X


Version 2.2 (January 11, 2010) - "As time goes by"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At first: Happy Birthday Gaston!!!

Another year slipped by and we are curious what the year 2010 will bring.
So at the start of 2010 we finally bring you a new release. With Brian now
working hard on Visual Pinball and putting out lots of new VP versions the
release schedule of PinMAME looks really slow, but let us say it is just
because PinMAME is rock solid.

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Support for Capcom shaded lamps (using ChangedDMD array)
Reduced DE DMD clock to 2 MHz, making games & sounds sync better
Reversed EOS switches for F14 Tomcat
Corrections for shallow Gottlieb driver prototypes
Kiss prototype moved to own source file kissp.c
Re-added comments to byvidpin.c
Gottlieb 9-segment digits replaced with legible alphanumerics (in DEBUG mode only)
Added four more key columns (triggered by Q-Z through R-V combinations, DEBUG only)
Added support to compile PinMAME with GCC 4.0, hopefully this will create interest for someone to build a Linux version
Replaced void* by genf* for GCC 4.0

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Gottlieb Strikes n' Spares (rev. 1)
Gottlieb World Challenge Soccer (disp. rev. 2)
Gottlieb Mario Andretti (prototype rev. 4)
Sega Wack-a-Doodle-Doo
Williams F-14 Tomcat (P-3, P-4)

WMS No Good Gofers (rev. 1.0), thanks to Steve Ellenoff


Version 2.1 (February 1, 2009) - "Keep 'em coming!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, so six months have passed yet again - amazing how time flies.
Despite the fact that all major manufacturers are emulated by now, there's
still enough to do to iron out all of the bugs and inaccuracies.

From time to time a few new games show up unexpectedly, like the new batch
coming in from tecnopinball.org in January: three new Juegos Populares games,
also Inder Atleta, and another oddball: Videodens "Break".
Some special greetings go to the makers of that invaluable resource site! :)

Despite the fact there is NO manual or schematics drawing to work with yet,
we managed to get Break working somehow - Spanish manufacturers were pretty
much fixated on the Z80 cpu and the AY-8910 sound chip, so it wasn't
all that hard really...

Jac van Ham, a rare Dutch manufacturer, joins the club with a game called
"Escape", adding a new CPU (TMS9980-A) to our core at the same time.

Some people contributed by providing new dumps for known bad roms as well:
David Seidman finally managed to get good reads off Black Sheep Squadron.
Jerry Clause re-read the U6 speech rom on Flash Gordon's vocalizer set, so
the hissing and stuttering is gone now.

Thanks to all our contributors, especially to Inkochnito for locating some
very hard to find roms over and over again all those years! What would we
do without you? -- Hmm, a lot more vacation, I guess (just kidding)! ;)

On the emulation side of it, sound was improved for Bally games using the
old "Sounds Plus" sound board, so it plays a few more sounds now.
Also, Gottlieb System 80B had another issue with melody playing at game start
which wasn't supposed to happen at all.
In the same vein, Jokerz, Pool Sharks, and Blackwater 100 had their sound
startup issues corrected, meaning that BW100's sound is finally working BTW.

Well, that's basically it. So enjoy our latest feat, and "keep 'em coming!"

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Fixed a bug for Bally-51 Sounds Plus
Fixed sound issues on Gottlieb System 80B
Fixed Blackwater 100 sound startup
Fixed startup sound for Jokerz / Pool Sharks
Corrected Playmatic Last Lap, game works now
Better working Bally 68701 prototype games
Added TMS9980-A cpu support

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Bally Party Zone L-3  [ipdb.org]
Added WMS Banzai Run G-3 (German)  [ipdb.org]
Added Juegos Populares: Featon, Petaco, Aqualand  [tecnopinball.org]
Added Jac van Ham Escape  [Inkochnito / Ronald Knor]
Added Videodens Break (NVRAM not working yet)  [tecnopinball.org]
Added Inder Atleta  [tecnopinball.org]
Added Flash Gordon Prototype rev. 2 (working)  [pinballjail]
Corrected checksums for Bally Flash Gordon (vocalizer sound)  [Jerry Clause]
Corrected checksums for Astro Black Sheep Squadron  [David Seidman]


Version 2.0 (August 1, 2008) - "Free Play Only!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This major version number change has nothing to do with new functionality for
once - it was done to mark a different milestone in the PinMAME development:
from this day on, anybody will be free to compile Visual PinMAME for himself,
so the four formerly crypted files are available in their unencrypted version
from our source code repository now!

At the same time the expiration date was removed, so this version is both
totally OPEN SOURCE and NEVER-EXPIRING at the same time. Well worth a 2.0,
what do you think? ;)

On a sad note, this means we won't emulate the new S.A.M. system by Stern for
quite some time to come - because of the same reason Visual PinMAME was closed
source before: once you're able to emulate one of the games using that
platform, all of the other games will work instantaneously as well!

However, development on all other manufacturer's platforms is continuing.
Playmatic games are working a little by now, and we will see more improvement
in the future for sure; sound is next on our issue list.

The TMS5200 is about the most complicated piece of hardware to emulate it
seems; Lord Nightmare spends almost all of his free time to get it right,
and we'll keep track of the latest outcomings as used in MAME, and will port
the updates to PinMAME as soon as they are available.
With this release, the speech sounds no longer as "hollow" as it did before,
and a few chirps and clicks are gone by using the TMS5200 specific emulation.

Some more (Nuova) Bell games were added, and a dart-based pinball conversion
kit for Bally machines was found by JRR (thanks!)
Brian also came up with Alvin G.'s "USA Football". :)

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Added new debugger command CODELIST
Fixed some disassembler glitches in the 6809 debugger
Better TMS5200 emulation for Bally / Zaccaria games that use it
Updates CDP1802 CPU to lastest MAME core

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Bell's Tiger Rag (thanks to Inkochnito & Hans Balk)
Added Nuova Bell's World Defender (-"-)
Added Nuova Bell's Dark Shadow (-"-)
Added Nuova Bell's Skill Flight (-"-)
Added Nuova Bell's Cobra (-"-)
Added Nuova Bell's Top Pin (-"-)
Added Nuova Bell's U-Boat 65 (-"-)
Added Grand Products' 301/Bullseye (thanks to Inkochnito & J.R.Robertson)
Added Alvin G.'s USA Football


Version 1.60 (April 18, 2008) - "For Tanja"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This latest release took a little longer as originally expected because
a good friend of Gerrit, Tanja, suddenly died at at the age of 29 years.
It took him a while to overcome the loss...

This release sees an update to the HC55516 sound chip used for speech/FX on
all WMS games from Gorgar up to Twilight Zone. Static noise and distortion
levels are reduced, and generally sound reproduction is clearer than before.
At the same time, Bally's "Xenon" and "Flash Gordon" using the vocalizer
sound board were increased in speech volume.

A fix was added for "The Sopranos" so the game will not crash any longer
after starting the "Bing!" mode, or the Boss mode.

And finally, with the addition of "Hoops", the Gottlieb collection is finally
complete in PinMAME, with the exception of some kits (like Amazon Hunt II)!

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Changes applied to sound reproduction of HC55516 chip
Fixed memory reads for Whitestar games (eg. The Sopranos)
Added support for some Bally prototype games

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Gottlieb Hoops (thanks to Ingo Kramer and Armin Bernemann)
Added Bally Eight Ball Deluxe prototypes (thanks to Kelley)
Added Williams Star Trax prototype (thanks to Kelley)
Added Shuffle Inn (minus one sound rom)


Version 1.59 (February 17, 2008) - "The lost sounds"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet another bugfix release - just a little more than two weeks later!

Gottlieb's System 3 has now access to all of the content of the OKI chip's
speech & sound roms, enabling some long-lost quotes like "Jackpot!" on
Stargate, or "You need another coin" on Barb Wire.
At the same time the sampling speed was adjusted, for it was playing too
fast before, and made some game soundtrack sound real bad (eg. Wipeout)!

Some preliminary sound was added for the Zaccaria 1-player games. It probably
sounds nothing like the original, for lack of comparison sound clips mostly!

A few clones and new games were added, for instance the "Addams Family Values"
coin dropper, and the newly-found Rock Encore. So nothing spectacular here. ;)

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Full OKI 6295 rom support for Gottlieb System 3 games
Decreased sampling frequency by 5.6% for games using the OKI 6295 chip
HSTD flashing in all player score panels for Gottlieb System 1 games
Preliminary sound support for Zaccaria prototype machines

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Addams Family Values (coin dropping game)
Added Rock Encore (different sound version for Premier's "Rock")
Added NBA Fastbreak U2 sound version 0.4 (gives a warning but still plays)
Added Baby Pacman home roms by Okaegi


Version 1.58 (February 1, 2008) - "The complete series"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is more of a bugfix release. It does not implement any new features
besides the inclusion of Zaccaria's "Ski Jump", which makes this series
complete (with the exception of sound).

The first and probably most important issue is the bug fix for the PPS-4/2
CPU used on Gottlieb System 1 games. Version 1.57 had a bug left that kept
the bonus from accumulating properly (or counting down, for that matter),
and another "bug" that kept the game diagnostics / adjustment menu from
progressing through its items. Actually if you look at the data sheets for
the PPS-4, it seems the emulation was *correct* in 1.57 and now we had to
deliberately introduce a bug so it works!?
Well, never mind now - as long as it plays fine. :)

Next, we are quite worried by the fact that many Gottlieb / Premier games
have sounds missing, so some effort was put into getting these to work.
Most notably, all of the drum sounds were missing from System80B games
of the first generation. Well, not anymore now! ;)
Also, the general output volume of the SP0250 sound/speech chip was too low
so far, making most bass sounds almost inaudible, so we cranked that up!
Finally, Gerrit turned off the channel suppression feature of the OKI6295
ADPCM chip, so now essentially every started sound will play until it ends,
or until it's cut short by another sound playing on the same voice channel.
This, of course, is a step back in terms of hardware accuracy, so it won't
last long... it was done as a quick fix to show the hardware is capable of
producing more sounds than in did in previous releases, and maybe to find
a way of getting it right someday.

For all 6-digit display haters out there, we added support for Oliver's
7-digit Gottlieb conversion roms. Doing so, Gerrit also extended the "bios"
system to these games: you can now keep the System80/A system roms common to
all of those games in the gts80 / gts80a sets, without the need to copy them
into each and every Gottlieb rom set. Same goes for the sound PROM used on
early System80 and late System80A games: these may go into gts80s / gts80as,
who in turn inherit from gts80 / gts80a.
Sounds complicated? Well - it's not.

However, as MAME architecture does not support multiple inheritance for games,
this produces one little problem: some Gottlieb games (using the sound and
speech board) have sound-only clones with completely different roms.
These three games (Volcano, Black Hole, and Devil's Dare) need to be split
into different sets now, as they don't have a single rom file in common.
Also, the new 7-digit common roms must go into their own sets (eg. spiderm7)
because those games already inherit from their 6-digit parents, and thus can't
inherit from a common set with support for the 7-digit system roms anymore.
This sounds even more complicated? Erm - well, maybe a little. ;)

So, have fun now and enjoy the most finite state of PinMAME there ever was.

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Fixed two bugs in PPS-4 emulation (corrects Gottlieb System 1 games)
Enabled missing drum sounds on Gottlieb System 80B games
Increased general output volume of the SP0250 sound/speech chip
Disabled muting option for OKI 6295 chip to produce more output in GTS3 games
Fixed GI support for all five GI strings on Who Dunnit and JackBot
Enabled sound solenoid outputs on Gottlieb System 1
Removed tones from Cleopatra, Sinbad, and Joker Poker (those use chimes)

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Zaccaria Ski Jump
Added Okaegi's 7-digit conversions of Gottlieb System80 games
Added the "machinaZOIS" clone of ShaqAttaq, created by a Czech programmer team


Version 1.57 (December 2, 2007) - "System 1"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The year is 1987, and NASA launches the last of America's deep space probes.
In a freak mishap, Ranger 3 and its pilot, Captain William "Buck" Rogers
are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support
systems and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later.

We had begun to think it would take 500 years to emulate Gottlieb System 1...
but thanks to an anonymous MAACA member, we finally got good reads of the bios
chips and they are now emulated.
Get out your cards and backgammon boards, lucky Buck is back!

1.57 - Changes Twiki says you don't want to know
Added Stern Harley Davidson (Harley 3.0)
Added Stern Speech emulation - sample files are no longer necessary
Added Gottlieb System 1 emulation - still has a bonus count bug
Improved GI dimming
Added Inder Lap By Lap
NBA Fastbreak Clock emulation corrected


Version 1.56 (August 19, 2007) - "Allied Leisure"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This update finally includes support for all the Allied Leisure games
operating on their 6504 CPU platform. It was quite some struggle to add those,
we started as far back as 2002 in trying to locate the RRIOT 6530 chips from
the CPU board in order to get their ROM contents dumped.

We encountered several setbacks. At one point, a guy offered his chips to be
dumped, but then suddenly vanished, and then famous community people denied
to help up dump chips, even though they definitely had the capabilities! :(

Just when we thought we'd never make it through this worldwide conspiracy
preventing Allied Leisure to be emulated at any point, Brian suddenly managed
to buy an Allied Leisure "Take Five" machine off eBay, and Pascal Janin of
France was kind enough to dump the chips for us (HUGE Thanks!!!), so now this
task is finally accomplished, and one of the last remaining well-known
manufacturers joined our club of pinball emulated. :)

Since all of those Allied Leisure games use the exact same code set, you will
only need ONE copy of the dumps, packed up as a driver called "allied".
All eleven games will then run off the same code, without the need to
duplicate the rom dumps over eleven different drivers!

In the same vein, you can now run all the GamePlan model 110 games (Foxy Lady
to Chuck-A-Luck) on the same set of roms, as a driver called "gp_110".

This method is based on MAME's "bios" support for some games like NEO-GEO,
where each game is using a shared set of boot code. The difference on PinMAME
is just that there simply aren't any additional roms for the pinball games. ;)

Also thanks to JohnnyPop for providing the Titanic & Monopoly redemption roms.

Changes:

*** CORE/CPU ***
Added support for Allied Leisure hardware (Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn)
Enabling "bios" files to prevent rom code duplication (Gerrit Volkenborn)
Preventing AT91 cpu crash occurring when emulation was restarted (Steve Ellenoff)
Removed display fading (on Gottlieb) again, as it was faulty. (Gerrit Volkenborn)

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Added Sega Titanic / Stern Monopoly redemption games (Gerrit Volkenborn)
Added Williams STTNG LX1, LX2, LG7 (Brian Smith)
Added Zacaria Space City / New Star's Phoenix (Gerrit Volkenborn)
Updated Sega Space Jam / ID4 sound with correct dumps (Steve Ellenoff)
Updated Stern Simpsons Pinball Party to version 5.00 (Gerrit Volkenborn)


Version 1.55 (March 30, 2007) - "Let there be Light"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy 6th Birthday to PinMAME & Visual PinMAME! :)

After all these years, we're finally seeing the light on two of our longest
standing missing features! In honor of the 6th year since our first release
we bring you our latest efforts.

Thanks to Aaron Giles for once again blowing us away with his
BSMT2K emulation improvements. Full support for the 'mysterious' compressed
samples is now a reality. Despite the numerous rewrites Steve had to do to
convert the code from the latest MAME core into our older core, it's working
great!

There's also a small enhancement to the Votrax SC01 speech chip output,
enabling the chip to alter its sample rate at runtime which improves sound
on many if not all games that used it!
To all Gottlieb System80 and Taito lovers, this is for you!

A special last-minute treat by PinMAME's founder and "not so retired" developer
Steve Ellenoff: GI circuit brightness support for WPC games is finally here!

Special thanks to Steve for this tremendous addition, which would have been the
number one event for him this month - if it wasn't the impending birth of his
third child expected to arrive any day! :)

Changes:

*** SOUND ***
Improved BSMT2000 support (Steve Ellenoff - thanks Aaron)
Improved Votrax SC01 support (Gerrit Volkenborn)
Correct sound support for Elvis (Steve Ellenoff)

*** CORE/CPU ***
Improved (and faster) AT91 emulation (Steve Ellenoff)
Added GI dimming support for WPC games (Steve Ellenoff)

*** ROM SUPPORT ***
Updated Alien Poker multiball (Oliver Kaegi)
Updated Eight Ball Deluxe clone (Oliver Kaegi)
Added Bell Cosmic Flash (Oliver Kaegi)
Added Nineball clone (Oliver Kaegi)
Added Demolition Man home roms (Brian Smith/Gerrit Volkenborn)
Added Theatre Of Magic home roms (Gerrit Volkenborn - needs to have cheats enabled to work)
...and some other updates we just don't remember right now. :)


Version 1.54 (December 23, 2006) - "One DLL to rule them all!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy birthday Steve!
It's been a challenging 6 months since the release of 1.53.
We've added preliminary support for NSM, Wico, and LTD.
LTD is closest to working for these newly supported systems.
Also, a minor correction for the display properties -
the off state can now be set like the other levels.
Nuova Bell is now playable with sound - needs improvement
Thanks to Mike McAndrew for providing the correct sound rom for Rat Race.


Version 1.53 (June 1, 2006) - "GO FASTER!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been 10 months since our last release.  Every time we thought about making
this available, a new issue cropped up that we couldn't resist.  Just one more

Version 1.52 (August 1, 2005) - "The first light doesn't count!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PinMAME developers meeting in Atlanta (Devcon 2005) took place no more than two weeks ago,
but already we have been able to add signficant improvements as a result of all the great sessions
we had together! It was great getting to meet each other in person for the first time ever.
Next time we hope Martin, Tom B, and Okaegi can join in the fun!

Let me use this occasion to thank all the great pinball fans in and around the city of Atlanta, GA
for their unparalleled enthusiasm, support and hospitality in hosting our meetings, and helping us
to find bugs and missing features we never would have had known about otherwise. A huge thank you to
Al, Craig, Jeff, and Jon, for tons of pinball fun and the best of times! You guys are great!!! :)

We also decided as a team that there's no real need to upgrade to the latest M.A.M.E. core.
We now have support for all the CPUs ever used on pinball hardware, and all the other type chips
that aren't supported yet won't probably be supported by M.A.M.E. anytime soon either,
so we'll stick with the tested, proven, reliable, and FAST older 0.76 core.
Why break a good thing?

Amazing how time flies: Okaegi and TomB joined the team a year ago this month!
Thanks to both of them for contributing so much to the project since then!!!

Much to our surprise we've added some nice improvements since the 1.52 beta release
just six short weeks ago, so enjoy our latest version!

Version 1.51 (January 11, 2005) - "Coming of age" (Happy 36th Birthday Gerrit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PinMAME has grown up to be a relatively stable and mature software with only little
quirks and issues left open... a few of which are solved with this release! :)
Hopefully, no new bugs were added.

A few old bugs could be squashed, like the hangup bug on some Zaccaria games,
thanks to the MAME guys finally fixing the opcode timing on the Signetics 2650.
Unfortunately this means you'll get less time on your bonus ball, but that's the
way those games really worked, unfortunately... ;)

The Visual PinMAME port also received some important updates; so make sure
to read the "whatsnewVPM.txt" File too!

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Zaccaria: All games are working now as far as the main CPU board is concerned;
  The switch issue for generation 1 games is fixed, as well as the lockup problem
  on some generation 2 games.
  A few games are missing sound, or it may still be incorrect.
  [Thomas Behrens, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Corrected IRQ values for all games based on Bally hardware (once more).
  I'm afraid this won't be the last time we touched this either... ;)
  [Oliver Kaegi, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Fixed the 4094 serial decoder emulation, correcting Life Lamps on "Champion Pub".
- Corrected CPU clock for GamePlan CPU sound boards
- Display fixed on Nuova Bell "Formula1 GP" (game still not working though)
- Set DCS CPU clock to 10 MHz exactly
- Corrected "Monopoly" waterworks flipper mech
- Corrected "Scared Stiff" spider wheel mech
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Fixed the 6532 RIOT emulation
- Added new sound board for Gottlieb System80A not using the Votrax SC-01 chip,
  thereby fixing "Royal Flush Deluxe" and "Goin' Nuts" sound issues
- Fixed Hankin sound issues
  [Tom Haukap]

- Fixed sound on WMS Space Shuttle
  [Thomas Behrens]

- Corrected sample support for Bally-32/-51 sound boards
  [Oliver Kaegi]

New Features
------------
- Emulation of alphanumeric Alvin G. games (Punchy, Soccer Ball) with sound
  [Steve Ellenoff, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Driver for Inder (Italy) added (Bushido not working yet)
- Driver for Juegos Populares (Spain) added (still some sound problems)
- Added 2 prototype games: Atari "Road Runner", WMS "Rat Race"; also many clones
- Added sound emulation for GamePlan "Andromeda"
- Added auxiliary solenoids for Sega games
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Emulation of the Stern SB-100 sound board
  [Oliver Kaegi]

- Separated ARM7 core code for easier maintenance and to allow other cpu cores to
  be easily built using it.
  Also optimized the ARM7 core a bit, which resulted in some decent speed ups (10-20FPS)
- Modified AT91 CPU Emulation to use new ARM7 core
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Automatically turning off sound if missing sound ROMs are detected
  [Tom Haukap]


Version 1.50 (November 1, 2004) - "Sound of the future"
-------------------------------------------------------
The future of PinMAME has never looked or sounded better!

With new team members Thomas Behrens and Oliver Kaegi making huge and immediate contributions,
and Steve's temporary break from retirement, this release is destined to be one of the largest and
most significant yet. Many often requested features and bug fixes are included, as well as
several new hardware systems. Pinball fans will definitely be pleased with this release.
It's so much stuff, we cannot guarantee we listed all the items contained... :)

Amazingly, Steve wrote an Atmel AT91 core ready to emulate the new Stern sound,
as used on Stern's LOTR and later games. There still are some issues with it, so
for instance, Elvis is not working correctly yet, and it's also running too slow, seems
anything less than 3-4Ghz won't get 60 FPS. But still this is a major breakthrough,
so we chose to add it for you to check out.

BTW, this should really be the final version being built on the MAME 0.76 basis,
but it's proven to be rather stable so far, so who knows? ;)

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Bally 6803: improved display/lamp operation and fixed a problem with switches
  41 to 48 for all games of this family. These games should run fine now.
  Also flipper keys can now be used to navigate the service menue on Blackwater
  and Truckstop.
  [Gerrit Volkenborn, Thomas Behrens]

- WMS System 11 and Data East: Fixed code to remove erraneous solenoid "spikes".
  While this primarily fixes DE Playboy 35th Anniversary, all Sys11/DE games
  will show more precise solenoid operation now.
  [Martin Adrian, Thomas Behrens]

- Corrected IRQ value for all games based on Bally hardware
  [Oliver Kaegi, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Corrected half byte ram bug in Bally Video/Pin driver. (Baby Pacman attract mode lamps now working properly)
  [Oliver Kaegi]

- Fixed some bugs in 8051 cpu core
- Adjusted CPU & FIRQ frequency on the Alvin G games
  (Sounds much better to me now, but still need access to real machine to confirm)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- WMS System 3 to 7: Improved solenoid smoothing method. This gives more accurate
  flashers (e.g. on Firepower) and knockers.
  [Martin Adrian]

- WMS System 3 to 7: Fixed/Added support for game adjustment dip switches.
  With proper scripting support, these can now be used to adjust game settings as
  described in the manuals.
- Stern Golden Cue and Sharkey's Shootout: These games are now working. Emulation
  support for the upper left flipper is still missing.
  [Thomas Behrens]

New Features
------------
- Spinball hardware emulation including full Sound and DMD support (some strobing issues left)
  (Big thanks to inkochnito for posting links to both the manual and rom so we could access them)
- Mr. Game hardware emulation including sound and video support (still some video & sound issues)
  (Thanks to Steve, who acquired two Mr.Game machines just so work on the emulation could begin)
  [Steve Ellenoff, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Added tons of new games and clones
  [Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Emulation of Stern Pinball's new Sound board - Used on LOTR and newer games.
  (HUGE THANK YOU TO DESTRUK FOR DONATING HIS OWN $ TO BUY AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
   LOTR SOUND BOARD WITHOUT WHICH THE EMULATION COULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ACHIEVED!!)
- Working Technoplay driver (X-Force) including display, lamps, solenoids, switches.
  (Need sound roms to be able to begin work on sound emulation)
- New ARM7TDMI CPU Core and Atmel 9140008 CPU Core (for new Stern Sound)
- Added External Hardware Addressing to 8051 cpu core
- Added support for Serial UART mode 1 to 8051
- Emulation of the 4094 Serial shifter chip (used in Championship Pub Dual LEDS)
- Preliminary Nuova Bell driver (F1 Grand Prix) - (not really working yet)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Sound support for Zaccaria games from Winter Sports to Locomotion
  (some sounds not correct yet, need to compare to real table sounds)
- Added AFM Saucer LEDs, and CP life lamps
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Old Stern: emulation of the SB-300 and samples support for the VSU-100 Speech board
- Bally: Samples support for early -32 and -50 sounds; much more accurate than before.
  [Oliver Kaegi]


Version 1.32 (May 1, 2004) - "MayDay Edition"
-------------------------------------------------------------
Not a lot of new stuff in here, but this release is needed to ensure people can enjoy
PinMAME for a while without any new glitches that we might introduce by switching
over to the new MAME core architecture started with MAME version 0.79;
We have already ported all the drivers and self-made CPU cores, and we ran into some
serious problems, so this might take a while...

Apart from that, some improvements were made to the existing code, especially for
the GTS80A games. Tom succeeded in emulating the Votrax chip closer to the real thing
than we might ever get, so you will now listen to the original phonemes the chip
produces in all their four possible intonations (try the attract mode of "Cavaleiro
Negro" and wait for him to sing to you...)! :)
Also, the timer bug with the 6532 RRIOT chip was corrected, so we could re-install
the unhacked version of timer.c again. Any slowdown problems on Gottlieb games
should be a thing of the past now, and the slam tilt is working again too.
Tom brought back the long-lost Hankin sound emulation, too. Thanks a lot!

Furthermore, there was a new CPU included that's used on the early Zaccaria
single-player games, like Strike, or Ski Jump: The National Semiconductor SC/MP,
or "Scamp", as it's commonly called... a most peculiar piece of Processor history.

Not much more, I'm afraid. We are all pretty busy lately, and we're missing Steve's
work a lot! Still, have fun playing around with this latest release. :)

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Major improvement to the Votrax SC01 emulation (speech synthesis based
  on samples from the original chip from now on!)
- Gottlieb System 80A games working as supposed, including Slam tilt,
  and without the need for any hacks in the timer section.
- Fixed Hankin sound back to where it was before it was broken.
  [Tom Haukap]

- adjusted the "6" and "9" numbers in Atari & Gottlieb games to look correct
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Added the 4 missing lamp columns for Williams Firepower
  [Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn]

New Features
------------
- new CPU: National Semiconductor SC/MP, needed for early Zaccaria games
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- some new clones for Taito & Williams games
- Added roms for Stern's "Ripley's Believe It or Not"
  [Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.31 (December 23, 2003) - Happy 32nd Birthday Steve
-------------------------------------------------------------
They say that history repeats itself, and we would have to agree!
It was exactly 2 years ago to the day that PinMAME was released with a major new breakthrough in sound
emulation, namely BSMT emulation, at the time.

Today, the major new breakthough is fully working Capcom sound, which will no doubt make this release
one of the best releases in the history of the project. This achievement was without question the most
difficult challenge ever faced (even more than the original capcom emulation itself). Along with the new
sound support, additional improvements in the capcom emulation, and a major speed increase bring
the reality of capcom pinball emulation to life like never before.

We also worked around the bug preventing the Gottlieb System 80A games from working introduced with
the 1.30 release; it turned out they worked with the "buggy" timer system from MAME 0.75 alone,
as opposed to all the other games. The games will still lock up on slamming, but that's minor...

Bally games using the "Squalk & Talk" sound also received an update:
Sound is no longer breaking up, or speech becoming garbled during a game.
Maybe it's also sounding a bit closer to the original chip now, but that's not confirmed.

On a bittersweet note, project leader Steve Ellenoff will be retiring from the project as of this release.
With a new child on the way, and massive new real life job committments to meet, he simply doesn't see
much time in his future for contributing to PinMAME. Steve would like to personally thank everyone he's
worked with over the years who've contributed their time and effort into making PinMAME such a
great success. He further would like to add that it's been an honor for him to have been at the healm of
one of the coolest software projects ever, and he is thankful to have had the opportunity to help make the
incredible advances the software has made over the years.

Gerrit Volkenborn will be taking over the project lead position and will no doubt continue to
improve this great project! Not without serious help from Tom & Brian, however... ;)

Happy holidays to everyone and we hope you enjoy our latest release!


Bugs Fixed
----------
- Missing 50V Solenoid Detection in Capcom Games fixed (reports as 99V but that's fine)
- Flipper Football & Kingpin now fire 50V solenoids
- Data East/Sega 192x64 DMD games should now be as fast as they were in version 1.12.2
  (since the 68306 cpu core now no longer slows down the original 68000 cpu emulation)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- TMS5220 speech emulation more reliable & accurate
- Gottlieb System 80A games working again
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

New Features
------------
- Major speed boost in the 68306 cpu core, which means Capcom emulation is now much faster!
- Fully working Capcom Sound emulation (might still be some minor issues, but overall it's excellent)
- Added multi chip TMS320AV120 MPG Audio Decoder Sound core
- Upgraded 8051 CPU core to handle 8752 CPU core functionality
- Added UART serial port support to 8051 core, plus a few new timer modes
- Implemented 68306 DUART Serial ports & Timer functionality
- Added mostly working X9241 Digital EPot to Capcom Sound board emulation.
- Added multi chip capability to the 6845 CRT video driver (will be needed for Gottlieb Strikes N Spares)
- Added some new features to the debugger (Shift+Enter command, Sound Enabling/Disabling, Stack pointer hilight)
- Changes to allow sound commander to work in debug mode for easier testing
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Moved to MAME .75 core (.76 for some drivers, depending on the timer implementation)
- Added lots of clones
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
------------------------------
This release is probably one of the most significant releases we've ever had!
With newly added fully working support for Alvin G & Co. and playable Capcom emulation
we finally have support for all the "well known" manufacturers. Most of the remaining
manufacturers games are very rare or hard to find info on, so in a sense we have pretty
much as complete support for all games as we can get.. Sure some information may pop
up for some of the more obscure manufacturers, and we'll be sure to add them, but most
likely, the current supported hardware is pretty much final.

Additionally, several bugs that have plaqued PinMAME for a very very long time have
been fixed or worked around, such as the infamous Black Knight sound issues
which are now fully working!

Of course, there's still quite a lot left to do to improve PinMAME, adding Capcom sound
support being one of them. That will be quite complicated and will surely keep us busy
for quite awhile!

Additionally, we've expanded core support for alternate rom revisions so that many older
rom revisions can be used. This change will require some current romsets to be renamed.
Please see the enclosed "alias.txt" file for details, and use the included "romupd.bat"
file to update the names of all affected rom zip files which you are legally entitled to have.

Unfortunately, the switch to the MAME 74 core has created a number of new bugs which we did not have
time to correct before the release (although we tried really hard!).
We apologize for the inconvenience and will try to correct them as quickly as possible.
If you find any we're unaware of, please let us know immediately.

One we're very well aware of - and it's driving us crazy - is all of the Gottlieb
System80A games - Devil's Dare to Ice Fever - are NOT working! All regular System80 games
from Spiderman to Eclipse work, however, and it's exactly the same CPU board!? :(

Despite these few little issues, we hope you'll enjoy our latest release which really marks
a very big milestone for us and for PinMAME.

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Implemented memory protection in wpc games.
- Fixed rom write problems in wms soundboards.
- Fixed bug with System 7 games (e.g. Black Knight sound now works)
- Fixed bug in .Solenoid() with solenoid 33-36 on wpc games.
  [Martin Adrian]

- Adjusted default volume levels for pre-DCS games to match my own machines levels (ex: drums were way too soft before)
- Corrected reversed comma and period in WPC Alphanumeric games
- Fixed (with an ugly hack) WPC Pre-DCS games that have pitch too low when music not playing
  (This was probably one of the longest/oldest bugs ever, as it's been there since day 1 of the original wpcmame emulator)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Adjusted Taito sound speed
  [Tom Haukap]

- Corrected Taito speech support (still does not sound like a Votrax SC01 though)
- Sound support for some older Zaccaria and GamePlan games (added SN76477 support)
- Switch debuffering bug fixed on old Zaccaria games
- Dip switch settings are stored in VPM on old Atari games now
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

Bugs Introduced
---------------
- Gottlieb System80A games are not working. We have to figure out why!
  This is one serious issue, and we'll try to get it fixed as quickly as possible.
  [Update to the MAME .74 core]

New Features
------------

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-----------------------------
Happy late 2nd birthday greetings to PinMAME!
Yes, 2 years and 2 days ago, PinMAME was officially released for the first time.
Hard to believe two years have passed since but then, not so hard when you
look at how much has changed in between!
PinMAME 0.99 didn't have support for a single working Bally game, and look
what it can do today: A total of 548 sets are supported, including 106 clones,
so excluding some test sets, there are some 430 individual working games in there.
Considering the worldwide total of solid state pinball games ever produced is
about 900, I'd say we're right on course... :)

This latest release is a much stabilized version of 1.20, only so much
has changed since that we decided to call the new version 1.21, to avoid
any more confusion than necessary...

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Fixed crashes in some DCS games.
- Removed flipper switches 5 & 7 from Dungeon & Dragons
- Corrected flipper switches for EBC
- Changed Mousin' around display to one row
- Some small fixes in Bally cheap-squeek sound (Black pyramid is still strange)
- Corrected 6809 core bug with CC register and exg + tfr instructions.
  (if a mamedev reads this: the bug is also in mame66)
- Fixed a small port read problem on 6803
- Corrected 68306 cpu emulation (Capcom)
- Merged Hankin driver with bally -35 games
- Rewrote gts80 driver.
- Added support for road kings' muxed slenoids
- mini dmd support for HRC & RCT
- bally video games now use same sound board as other bally games
- Added "special solenoid" handling for Grand Lizard & Space Station
- Added 8259 emulation (slightly modified from MESS source)
  [Martin Adrian]

- Greatly improved lamps in Baby Pacman, although there are still some issues.
- Gottlieb System 3 music and speech FINALLY working!! (Requires hefty system to work perfectly unfortunately)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Robocop sound working 100%
  [Martin Adrian, Steve Ellenoff]

- Improved Gottlieb System 80B sound
- Added comma segments to GTS80A games
- Increased CPU speed for Midway's Rotation VIII

  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

New Features
------------

  Only used in games that don't use Fliptronics flippers (before TAF)
  but it seems like many later games still activates the signal.
  Can be used to disable bumpers/slingshots in VPM
- Added GameOn and Tilt solenoid for GTS80 games (Sol 10 & 11)
  GameOn is adjusted to mean "game in progress and not tilted"

  [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.20 Beta (September 29, 2002)
--------------------------------------
The 1.20 version was destined to be the first one to use the new MAME core
and the new driver architecture introduced with MAME 0.58.
We used the MAME 0.59 sources to start with and aligned our own code
to fit this new architecture. This, however, led to massive code changes,
and also to some problems not easily solved!

One of the most prominent setbacks was the new way to trigger interrupts.
Whereas you could simply say "cpu_cause_interrupt()" in the old core, you'd
now have to use "cpu_set_irq_line(HOLD_LINE|ASSERT_LINE|PULSE_LINE)",
followed by "cpu_set_irq_line(CLEAR_LINE)" in case of HOLD_LINE or
ASSERT_LINE, yet not in every single case!
Also there seems to be no distinction between MACHINE_RESET and MACHINE_INIT
as MACHINE_INIT is called every time you press F3 on your keyboard!
Confused? Well, so were we...
On the other hand, the new driver structure is just marvellous when it comes
to including new machine drivers, and we also still want to stick close to the
original MAME code...

Now the end result of all our changes was good, but not perfect!
Some emulations will just freeze when reset (eg. GTS3), others will kill the
task without warning, others will just exit if you reset once too often.
To shorten a long story: we decided to release the new version, most notably
not to deprive you of all the nice new and improved drivers we added! :)
But be advised, we didn't call it a beta version without a good reason!
We'll probably switch to the (more stable and maybe faster?) 0.61 core soon
to see if it helps with some of the troubles we're currently experiencing.
So stay tuned, and enjoy the new stuff!

Version 1.12.2 (September 29, 2002)
-----------------------------------
This is a refreshed version of 1.12.1 WITHOUT any new features or games
(with the exception of Tag-Team Wrestling, which arrived late for the 1.12.1
release). Only the CRCs for bad and newly released ROMs have been corrected.
The 4 Zaccaria games supported by 1.12.1 have been removed, as they weren't
working at all! They will, however, inside PinMAME 1.20 beta and above!

This is a "safety" release to keep everybody up and running, as there are
some unsolved problems with the new M.A.M.E. 0.59 core implementation as
used by the 1.20 beta version. Read the "whatsnew.txt" of 1.20 beta for
closer details!

Bugs Fixed
----------
-Forced commas are back on all games that use them

New Features
------------
-Added support for Gottlieb's "Tag-Team Wrestling"
-Updated all ROM checksums to known good (or bad) values
-Added missing display on Bally's "Medusa"
 [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.12.1 (April 14, 2002)
-------------------------------
This is just considered a bugfix release for some issues that became apparent
with the 1.12 version. We're going to need more beta testers next time. :)
Only one more game showed up in the meantime, GamePlan's "Vegas".
Apart from that, everything else was a bug fix - more or less;
as some of these "bugs" were hidden pretty deep inside the MAME core -
like the illegal but still deliberately used 6502 opcode that crashed sound
on some Gottlieb games!

The next version will be based upon the 0.59 MAME core, which is a pretty big
change, so it may take a while... ;)

Bugs Fixed
----------
-Sound is back on Harley Davidson
-S11: Solenoids 20 & 21 separated again (Rollergames etc.)
 [Martin Adrian]

-DE: Removed sound bug that crashed Secret Service (and maybe others?)
-GTS3: Corrected key layouts for all games
-GTS3: Natural order restored for switches & lamps

 [Gerrit Volkenborn]

-GTS80: Added "illegal" opcode for BlackHole and Pink Panther (and maybe others?)
 [Tom Haukap]

New Features
------------

 [Tom Haukap]

-Atari sound improved (noise generation & different waveforms)
-Added correct support for GamePlan's "Vegas"
 [Gerrit Volkenborn]

-GTS80: Memory mapping and layout should now be 100%
 [Tom Haukap]
 [Martin Adrian]


Version 1.12 (March 29, 2002)
-----------------------------
Happy Birthday to PinMAME! It's hard to believe it's been 1 year since our initial release.
So much has been added in that time, it's really amazing to see how far we've come.
We look forward to another year even better than this one! We'd like to thank everyone for
their continued support and enthusiasm! It's great to see so many pinball fans come together and push to keep our hobby from dying.

Version 1.11 (February 3, 2002)
------------------
A good sized new release with working support from 2 new manufacturers (Hankin & Gameplan), as
well as preliminary support for 1 more (Zaccaria). Of course, we're thrilled to be able to
add working fully working Baby Pacman emulation, which has been a long standing request going back to the
very first few versions of PinMAME.
Finally, we close the book on missing Bally support, by adding working 6803 emulation.
Last but not least, we hope to have solved the sound stuttering/scratchy issues introduced
in version 1.10, but with so many possible configurations, it's hard to know for sure.
So please post on the forum if you still have trouble, and be sure to include your setup.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:
  This release has not been beta tested and may contain many bugs!
  We wanted to get a release out now, because for the next month or so, we won't have time,
  and we thought we should at least get the bugs from last version fixed and out the door.

Version 1.10 (December 23, 2001) - Happy 30th Birthday Steve
------------------------------------------------------------
This may very well be the most anticipated release of PinMAME to date: 4 Letters - BSMT.

What was once thought nearly impossible has become a reality for PinMAME,
thanks in large part to emulation wizard Aaron Giles(of MAME fame).
35 New Games now have fully working sound!
Thank you to the following for their help and support in trying to emulate the BSMT:
Destruk, Worf, DesAngel, RevenantUK, Guru

Gottlieb games also received a huge update: Finally solved the many issues with getting Gottlieb System 3
games to work. In addition, sound support was added for all System 80b games as well as the newer System 3 games.

As you can also see, we've realized, much like the MAME team, that using Beta naming is
rather tedious and annoying, so we've dropped it.

We know you'll enjoy this latest version of PinMAME as much as we do!!
