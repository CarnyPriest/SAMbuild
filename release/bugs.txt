Bugs in Pinmame that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------
(Note: Many of these bugs have been extremely difficult to track down and fix,
       so it take be a while before they can be corrected!)

 #1) Williams/Bally WPC: DCS sound still has some problems, only on high volume levels.
     (So don't use full volume (29-31) to avoid static noise)
     This seems to happen on real machines, too, but could also be just a sideeffect there of the amp and speakers.
     (Note that disabling the low pass filter in the DCS core in addition exposes some static noise on some machines, when playing certain samples -> DCS compression itself might be the cause?)

 #2) Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME.
     The most important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser,
     and accurate real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a workaround).

 #3) The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings.
     The printout will probably not work with other settings.

 #4) The name and year for each game were taken from the Internet Pinball Database
     (http://www.ipdb.org), and may not be 100% accurate!

 #5) Occasional pops/clicks on Capcom sound.

 #6) Occasional pops/clicks/crackling on Whitestar II sound, only on high volume levels.
     (~24 and above, for example on Nascar and Grand Prix, or even ~20 on LOTR, so avoid this)
     This seems to happen on real machines (verified on 2 different Grand Prix pinballs), too.

 #7) Data East/Sega/Stern/Gottlieb DMD timing is not 100% accurate.

 #8) Sound gets cut off in Alvin G games sometimes, and some weird notes in World Tour occasionally

 #9) Slugfest will work with "pinmame -cheat sf_l1". Same goes for Theatre Of Magic home version (tom_14h(c)).
     Alternately, check the "skip pinball startup test" in vpm.

#10) GTS80S DAC sound is off for most of the sound effects.

#11) Some setups crash when using the AT91 JIT compiled code (e.g. Whitestar II and SAM), disable AT91 JIT
     by setting "at91jit" to 0
