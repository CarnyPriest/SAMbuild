Bugs in Pinmame that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------
(Note: Many of these bugs have been extremely difficult to track down and fix,
       so it might be awhile before they can be corrected!)

 #1) Williams/Bally WPC: DCS sound still has some problems.
     (Don't use full volume (29-31) to avoid static noise)

 #2) Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME.
     The most important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser,
     and accurate real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a workaround).

 #3) The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings.
     The printout will probably not work with other settings.

 #4) The name and year for each game were taken from the Internet Pinball Database
     (http://www.ipdb.org), and may not be 100% accurate!

 #5) Occasional pops/clicks on Capcom sound

 #6) Occasional pops/clicks on Whitestar II sound, only on high volume levels (~24 and above, for example on Nascar)

 #7) Data East/Sega/Stern/Gottlieb DMD timing is not 100% accurate.

 #8) Sound gets cut off in Alvin G games sometimes, and some weird notes in World Tour occasionally

 #9) Slugfest will work with "pinmame -cheat sf_l1". Same goes for Theatre Of Magic home version (tom_14h(c)).
     Alternately, check the "skip pinball startup test" in vpm.
