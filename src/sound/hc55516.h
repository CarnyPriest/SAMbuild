// Set the known sample clock rate for an HC55516 chip.  'num' is the chip
// number - most games only use one HC55516 chip, in which case this should
// be 0.  If the game uses multiple chips, set the frequency for each chip
// individually.  This can be called from the init_GAME() routine for an 
// individual game driver to set that game's clock rate.
//
// This information isn't currently used for anything, but we're keeping
// the function (and the calls to it that were added for all WPC89 games)
// in case it turns out to be useful in the future.  During the 2019 revamp
// of the HC55516 code, we initially thought that it would be necessary (or
// at least would improve playback) to have pre-set clock data per game.
// Further work made that unnecessary; the emulator simply adapts in real
// time to the current playback rate.  If you want to determine the clock
// rate or rates used in a particular game, you can make a special build
// of hc55516.c with rate logging enabled - see hc55516.c for details.
