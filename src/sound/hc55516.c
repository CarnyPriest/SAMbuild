// HC55516/HC55536/HC55564 - a CVSD voice decoder chip
//

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Overview
//
// The HC55516 is a CVSD (continuously variable slope delta) modulation 
// encoder/decoder chip.  CVSD modulation was popular in the 1980s for digital
// voice encoding, because it provides decent fidelity for voice audio at low
// bit rates.  CVSD happens to work particularly well with the spectrum
// properties of human voice signals, so it was mostly used for that, and in
// fact you still see CVSD encoding (although not this particular chip) used
// in some modern applications, especially military communications devices.
// It's also one of the codec types included in the Bluetooth specs.
//
// The core of a CVSD encoder/decoder is a "syllabic filter".  This isn't the
// sort of filter that removes unwanted frequency components from the output
// signal; rather, it's essentially an analog computing element that helps
// compute the output signal.  The syllabic filter is characterized by a
// time constant (4ms in the case of the HC55516), which is one of the key
// parameters controlling the CVSD's behavior, along with a pair of voltage
// levels feeding into the filter (the "high" and "low" syllabic filter
// inputs).  The data sheet for the HC55564 can still be found on the Web
// as of this writing, although the chip has been out of production for a
// very long time.
//
// The HC55516 was part of a family of nearly identical chips that also 
// included the HC55536 and HC55564.  Apparently the only difference among
// these variations was the maximum sample clock rate supported, so they're 
// essentially interchangeable.  There's an unrelated family of CVSD decoders
// used in some older pinball machines, the MC3417 and MC3418, which have
// similar properties (in that they're also based on CVSD modulation) but
// aren't compatible with the HC555xx chips and had a somewhat different
// electrical setup (in particular, the MC341x chips used external analog
// components for the syllabic filter and estimator filter, whereas the
// HC555xx uses internal components and a purely digital implementation).
// The software emulations for the two chips are quite similar, and earlier
// versions of PinMAME used the same code for both, but we've separated
// them into their own modules now so that we can use the optimal numerical
// parameters and logic for each chip type.
//
// The chief difficulty in implementing a good HC555xx decoder for PinMAME
// comes from the way the sample rate is handled in the original pinball
// machine hardware.  In particular, the original sound boards didn't use
// a fixed clock to generate the sample data.  Instead, they sent bits to
// the hardware on an ad hoc basis from the software.  That means that,
// first, the sample rate can't be determined by studying the hardware
// schematics, as the clock rate is purely at the whim of the software,
// and second, that the clock rate isn't perfectly uniform from bit to bit,
// as the software source can't be relied upon to generate bits with equal
// timing.  In practice, the actual elapsed time from bit to bit in the
// same clip can vary by as much as a factor of two.  A corollary to the
// first point - that the rate is controlled by the software - is that the
// rate on one pinball machine can vary from clip to clip, and in practice
// this actually happens on many games (e.g., most System 11 games have
// two different sample rates).
//
// Our strategy for handling the sample rate clock is to delay the decoding
// step as long as possible.  The MAME audio stream mechanism gives us some
// inherent backlogging, so we take advantage of that.  Rather than decoding
// the input bits as we receive them from the pinball sound board emulation,
// we collect them in a buffer, with timestamps.  When MAME calls upon us
// to fill its PCM stream buffer, we use the buffered samples to determine
// the HC55516 clock rate for that run of samples retrospectively.  That
// lets us average the clock rate over a large number of bits, smoothing
// out the highly variable per-bit timing.  In practice, we *can* rely on
// the average timing over a large number of bits being stable, because the
// original machines would have sounded terrible if they didn't accomplish
// that.
//
// Another aspect of the ad hoc sample rate that makes this difficult to
// implement in MAME is that MAME further processes our output in the 
// digital domain.  On the original pinball hardware, the output from the
// HC55516 chip was an analog signal that was processed from that point on 
// in the analog domain, so the sample rate that went into generating that 
// signal was irrelevant from that point forward.  But for our setup, we
// can't emulate the rest of the pipeline as though it were analog; we
// produce a digital PCM sample and have to hand off a PCM sample to our 
// next stage, the MAME stream.  The snag is that variable timing again!
// The MAME stream has its own clock rate, and we have an ad hoc clock
// rate from sample to sample.  We have to match the rates when handing
// the samples off to MAME by digitally resampling at the MAME rate. 
// Converting between dissimilar PCM rates is a tricky problem, but
// fortunately MAME already incorporates libsamplerate, which exists
// specifically to solve the resampling problem.  The solution to our
// clock rate mismatch is to use libamplerate as an intermediary.  We
// take each sample from our HC55516 output, feed it to a libsamplerate
// converter, and pass the resulting resampled signal to MAME.

// ***** CLOCK RATE MEASUREMENT AND LOGGING *****
//
// The HC55516 doesn't have a fixed sample data rate; the rate is simply
// the speed at which the host sends samples.  If you want to determine the
// rate for a given pinball machine, this code has a rate logging feature
// you can enable.  This requires a special debug build:
//
// 1. Un-comment the line beneath this comment block
// 2. Rebuild PinMAME
// 3. Run the game you want to measure
// 4. Look through the file <ROM>.vpm_hc55516_bitrate.log
// 5. Add a call to hc55516_set_sample_clock() in init_GAME()
//
// The file <ROM>.vpm.hc55516.log will contain information on the clock
// rate as samples are played.  WPC89 games all use the same fixed clock
// rate (22372 Hz).  Most System 11 games use two different clock rates,
// with some clips playing at one rate and some at the other.  In
// principle, each clip could even have a unique rate.
//
// In the first iteration of the 2019 revamp of this code, we thought it 
// was going to be necessary (or would at least improve playback) to 
// pre-set the clock rate per game, so we added a routine to do this
// (hc55516_set_sample_clock()) and added corresponding calls to this
// routine to some init_GAME().  This didn't turn out to be needed after
// reworking the hc55516 code some more, but we left the routine and
// calls intact to preserve the sample rate measurements, in case they
// become useful again in the future.  At the moment, there's no need to
// add more of these, as the information is ignored if provided at all.

// Gain Selection
//
// The HC55516 emulation works in terms of a simulated analog voltage level 
// at the HC55516 analog output pin (pin 3, AO, on the real chips).  MAME,
// in contrast, works in terms of 16-bit PCM samples.  So we have to convert
// from the simulated analog voltage to a 16-bit PCM level.  
//
// Both formats represent linear wave amplitudes, so the general-purpose way 
// to select the gain is to choose the value that preserves the identical 
// dynamic range:  that is, the gain that maps the maximum analog voltage to 
// the maximum PCM value.  We use loudness compression curve with an input
// dynamic range of -DYN_RANGE_MAX to +DYN_RANGE_MAX (see below).  We 
// ultimately convert this to the INT16 range in the range compression step,
// but the initial gain calculation targes the wider range before compression.
// So the default gain is DYN_RANGE_MAX/V_HIGH.
//
// In practice, some games don't use all of the available dynamic range on
// the CVSD side.  It can be more pleasing in these cases to use a higher 
// than default gain that converts all of the actually used dynamic range on
// the CVSD side to the full scale on the PCM side, or (DYN_RANGE_MAX /
// highest actual voltage level).
//
// To aid in selecting an ideal per-game gain, you can enable dynamic range
// logging by #define'ing LOG_DYN_RANGE below.  That will generate a log file
// (<ROM NAME>.vpm_hc55516_dynrange.log) containing periodic updates with
// the maximum sample level seen so far, and the computed "max non-clipping 
// gain" (the gain that maps the maximum sample level to PCM full scale).

// Syllabic filter constants.  For an RC filter, the charge factor per
// clock period is given by:
//
//   exp(-clock_period/time_constant)
//
// where clock_period = 1/frequency and time_constant is the filter's RC
// time constant.  For normal analog filters, this would make the charge
// factor dependent upon the data clock frequency.  However, the HC55516
// data sheet has a note claiming that both of its filter time constants
// (syllabic filter and signal estimator, aka integrator) are inversely
// proportional to the data clock frequency.  That effectively makes the
// charge factors independent of the clock frequency, because:
//
//    time_constant = P / frequency  [where P is some constant value]
//    -> clock_period / time_constant = 1/frequency / (P/frequency) = 1/P
//    -> charge factor = exp(-1/P)
//
// The data sheet quotes the time constant values for a 16kHz rate, so we
// can recover the P value for each filter by plugging the quoted time 
// constants and 16kHz into the proportionality formula above, yielding 
// the following fixed charging factors:
//

// (mask binary 111 = 0x07).

// Syllabic filter high/low inputs.  These aren't documented in the HC55516
// data sheet, so we're guessing based on the audio signal specs.  The data
// sheet says that the audio signal output voltage at 0dB is 1.2V RMS, which
// implies a peak DC voltage of 1.7VDC.  The "low" input to the filter is

// Loudness compression function.  This takes a sample in linear space form

// Default gain.  This is the scaling factor to convert from the simulated
// analog output voltage from the HC55516 to a signed 16-bit PCM level.  Both
// representations are linear in wave amplitude, so preserving the identical
// dynamic range is simply a matter of multiplying by the PCM maximum value
// divided by the maximum analog voltage.  The maximum analog output voltage
// from a CVSD decoder is the same as the "high" input to the syllabic filter.
// (The physical HC55516 technically doesn't quite work that way, as it uses
// a digital implementation of the signal estimator filter, just like we do,
// and uses an internal DAC to convert that modeled filter to a true analog
// signal.  But our model omits that stage, as it's an implementation detail
// of the physical chip, so for the purposes of our mathematical model, the
// estimator filter is analog.)
//
// This is only the default gain.  The actual gain can be set at run-time

// full dynamic range for games that don't use the full analog voltage range

		// steps between the input and output streams can cause the output clock 
		// to get ahead of the input clock in such cases.  The same clock leapfrog
		// can happen in any group of bits, of course, but it doesn't cause trouble

		// time in the run will overwhelm the leapfrog effect, and the little bit
		// of jitter will get subsumed organically into the rate conversion.

		// So what to do when we encounter this oddball case?  A handful of bits
		// in isolation will just sound like a click or tiny burst of noise, if
		// it's audible at all, so we could probably get away with dropping the
		// samples entirely without anyone missing them.  However, just in case
		// the game really intended to output a little click or short burst of
		// noise, we'll retain them.  We obviously can't output them in negative
		// time, but we can at least pack them into a short time by converting
		// them at the output stream sample rate.  Remember, this only happens
		// when we have a handful of samples in the group, so we're only using
		// a handful of slots in the output stream.  To do this, force the rate
		// ratio to 1:1 by fiat.  This will make the little bit group sound sped
