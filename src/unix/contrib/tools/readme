5)	Name:		romulan.pl
	Author:		Nathan Hand <nathanh@chirp.com.au>
	Description:	Perl script I've been working on to keep track of
                        split romsets. Relies on xmame + unzip binaries being
                        available, doesn't support merged sets, doesn't
                        support unzipped sets, doesn't examine ~/.xmamerc,
                        doesn't do a lot really. I use it personally though,
                        and I find it useful.
                        
                        Has some neat routines (in perl) to get romset info
                        out of xmame or the zipfile. Might be useful to other
                        romset analyzer developers.

	Author:		Hans de Goede <hans@highrise.nl>
	Description:	A little script to run a random game in the root
			window for 2 minutes and then run another random game
			etc. Use this as the extern command for xscreensaver.
	Usage:		- compile the x11 version of xmame
			- install it somewhere in your path

			  /usr/games/xmame-screensaver

8)	Name:		mame-cd
	Author:		Mario J.Barchéin Molina <mbarchein@yahoo.es>
	Description:	A perl script which sorts MAME roms onto CDs by year and
			puts all clones on the same CD as the parent.
	Usage:		See the mame-cd file.  Mario also has this to add:
			* I don't know if it will do a good job if you don't
			  have all the roms.
			* Edit it and configure the parameters in the beginning
			  of the file.
			* It's not only for .54.  I've used it from 0.37b11 and
			  it has worked ok, but YMMV.
			* Make your CD images  with the "Symlink farm" option or
			  they will be 1.3 GB instead of 650 MB.
			* It's a beta program.  Don't blame me too much if it
			  doesn't work.
			* Of course is GPL.
			* I'd love feedback. :)

        Author:		David Griffith
        Description:	Lists which supported roms are missing from your 
			collection.
	Usage:		mame-listmissing [<options>] [<path>]

			<path>	Override whatever default path you've set for 
				where you keep your roms.  Must be a 
				colon-seperated path.

			-e	Extension.  If your rom files are contained in
				something other than .zip files, specify here or
				modify the default.  This option will go away
				if/when I decide to use a hash to handle
				extensions automatically.

			-h	Help.  You're reading it now.

			-v	Invert.  Cause listmissing to report roms that
				you have installed.
