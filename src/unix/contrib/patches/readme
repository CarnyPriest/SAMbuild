2)	Name:		boundary-check-patch
	Author:		Hans de Goede <hans@highrise.nl>

	Author:		??
	Description:	A first attempt at an autoconfigure script for xmame

6)	Name:		word-align-patch
	Description:	In the past the cpu-cores of mame used todo some
			unaligned word accesses making risc cpu's very
			unhappy. This patch used to correct this, but the
			cpu-cores have been fixed now. It might be worth
			trying this patch if you experience problems on a 
			risc machine (sparc/alpha etc)
