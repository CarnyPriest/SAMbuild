basic  Unix commands to compile and install xmame/xmess.</P>

</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>GNU make is MANDATORY in ALL Systems, even if you use a different
compiler. </LI>
<LI>On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core uses it. If
you don't have zlib, a stripped version is included with xmame. See:
<A HREF="xmame-doc-3.html#FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?">FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not while compiling?</A> and 
<A HREF="xmame-doc-3.html#FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?">FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?</A></LI>
<LI>You are encouraged to use a GNU development environment: gcc,
gmake, gnu- ar. Lots of problems are found due to the very permissive
syntax in gcc, so if you use a strictly ANSI C compiler, you'll get
lots of warnings, and if the version of xmame/xmess is not fully
debugged, compilation errors.</LI>
<LI>Xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or gcc-2.95, use
<CODE>-fno-strict-aliasing</CODE> to fix it. gcc-2.95.1 does work with <CODE>-fstrict-aliasing</CODE>,
and gives a nice speed increase.</LI>
<LI>Xmame compilation also breaks when using Red Hat 7's latest (as
of 16 January 2001) update for gcc. If you experience problems, please
either downgrade your compiler to the one included on the Red Hat
7 CD-ROM, or try replacing "gcc" in the Makefile with "kgcc", which will
invoke egcs-1.1.2. (But please see above about the <CODE>-fstrict-aliasing</CODE>flag.)

<LI>Download the xmame/xmess source files archive.</LI>
<LI>Move the xmame/xmess source files archive to a suitable work
directory. When you extract the archive, sub directories will be
created under the  work directory.</LI>
<LI>Rename the source files archive so its extension is .gz, so that
gzip doesn't complain. For example, change <CODE>xmame-0.34b1.1.tgz</CODE> to
<CODE>xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz</CODE></LI>
<LI>Use gzip -d to uncompress the archive. For example, type:
<PRE>
gzip -d xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz

 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Extract the files with tar. For example, type:
<PRE>
tar xvf xmame-0.34b1.1.tar

 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>After extracting the archive, change to the subdirectory created
by  the extraction process. For example, after extracting the xmame-0.34b1.1.tar
archive, a directory named <CODE>xmame-0.34b1.1</CODE> is created. Change to it.
This directory is the top of the source tree.</LI>
<LI>Copy makefile.unix to Makefile, the distributed Makefile is used
for development and is not a good starting point!</LI>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and change the settings according to your system.
The default <CODE>makefile.unix</CODE> is preconfigured to run under X11/Linux.
Be careful editing this file.
<UL>
<LI>If you intend to compile in X11 joystick support, type the following
to see the available Xdevice list:
<PRE>
make xlistdev; ./xlistdev

  
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Choose the desired device and re-edit Makefile, setting the option
X11_JOYNAME to the correct device.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Compile xmame/xmess by typing:
<PRE>
make

 
</PRE>

<LI>If the compile fails, report the problem to the author.</LI>
<LI><B>*** YOU MAY NEED TO BE root TO PERFORM THIS STEP ***</B> To install
xmame/xmess, type:
<PRE>
make install

 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>If you want you can now build xmame/xmess for another target/display
method, otherwise skip to the next step.
<OL>
<LI>If you want to also build for another target repeat repeat the
<CODE>"make"</CODE> and <CODE>"make install"</CODE> steps adding <CODE>"TARGET=&lt;target&gt;"</CODE> to the make
command for example:
<PRE>
make TARGET=mess
make install

  
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>If you want to also build for another display method repeat the
<CODE>"make"</CODE> and <CODE>"make install"</CODE> steps adding <CODE>"DISPLAY_METHOD=&lt;method&gt;"</CODE>
to the make command for example:
<PRE>
make DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install

  
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>You can also combine the 2 above for example:
<PRE>
make TARGET=mess DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install

  
</PRE>

</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>In your home directory, create a subdirectory called .xmame.</LI>
<LI>From the top of the source tree, copy the file doc/xmamerc.dist
to the ${HOME}/.xmame/ directory. (For xmess do
this for xmessrc)</LI>
<LI>If desired, copy xmamerc.dist to the global xmamerc location
as &quot;xmamerc&quot; (for xmess, copy xmamerc.dist to xmessrc).
The global xmamerc location is defined in the Makefile.</LI>
<LI>Edit ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc to match your preferences.
(For xmess, edit ${HOME}/.xmess/xmessrc)</LI>
<LI>Be sure that the DISPLAY and PATH environment variables are 
set correctly.</LI>
<LI>Make sure your ROM images are installed.</LI>
<LI>Start the X-Window System. (Unless you compiled for a different
display method in which case you skip this step.)</LI>
<LI>Start xmame/xmess. For example:

<H3>Linux i386</H3>

<P>Linux i386 is the platform I (Hans) use, so xmame should compile
without any hassles on Linux i386. (Note: The same is true for Lawrence
Gold.)</P>

<P>Some bugs have been found and worked around when using gcc27x,
please use egcs if available. If more gcc bugs popup, egcs will be
made mandatory, but I hope that won't be necessary.</P>

<P>It has been reported that some SoundBlaster AWE32 and VIA-82cxxx
(onboard) cards do not  correctly manage get_freespace(). If so,
you'll get some audio_ioctl() calls failed messages in console, and
if everything goes right a message that xmame/xmess is falling back
to timer based audio. If  this doesn't happen and sound isn't right,
try forcing timer-based  audio by starting xmame/xmess with <CODE>-timer</CODE>.</P>

<P>SB64/128PCI cards (Ensoniq 137x-based cards) also do not correctly
manage get_freespace(). Unfortunately, this doesn't result in failed
ioctl's; instead, they just ignore the calls. Xmame tries to autodetect
this and to fall back to timer-based audio. If this doesn't happen
and sound isn't right, try forcing timer based audio by starting
xmame/xmess with <CODE>-timer</CODE>.</P>

<P>Some have reported success using ALSA with OSS emulation (see
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">http://www.alsa-project.org/</A>). If you experience the above problems, this would certainly be
worth a try.</P>

<P>Also, I've tested sound using the PC-Speaker driver module. It
works!! But it needs <CODE>-timer.</CODE> Again, it should do this  automagically,
but you know what to do if it doesn't.</P>

<P>Distribution-Specific Comments:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc libraries,
which are both from the &quot;d&quot; series, other packages  need
to be installed or the build will fail. If compiling for svgalib,
the svgalib package from series &quot;d&quot; installed. If compiling
for the X-Window System, you must have xdevel package from series
&quot;x&quot; installed. These packages can be installed using the
&quot;yast&quot; utility included in the S.u.S.E. distribution.</LI>
<LI>Red Hat Linux is the operating system used by the author. xmame/xmess
should build correctly under Red Hat Linux. :-)
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H3>Linux PowerPC</H3>

<P>Linux PowerPC should work from now on. Here's an email from Andreas
Varga <CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at">sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at</A></CODE>, the Linux/PowerPC maintainer, describing the necessary steps:</P>

<P>Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with
SVGALIB</P>

<P>Makefile:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc </LI>
<LI>enable DISPLAY_METHOD = svgalib </LI>
<LI>enable ARCH = linux </LI>
<LI>remove -lvgagl from LIBS.svgalib in src/unix/unix.mak (only -lvga
is required)
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with
X11 </P>

<P>Makefile: </P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc </LI>
<LI>enable DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 </LI>
<LI>enable ARCH = linux 
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Another thing... sound is not working, because sound drivers
support is currently under development in Linux/PPC kernels...there
is an old driver that is a hacked Soundblaster driver, and newer
2.1.1xx kernels have a sound drivers based on Amiga DMA sound drivers...
Once this issues are settled there should be a full OSS-compatible
driver... sound should work then...</P>

<P>I can't speak about Joystick support...</P>

<P>The original Linux/PPC target changes in the Makefile were done
by me, but there are some other changes required to get it to compile...
Starting from October I will have some more time to work on this,
and I'll keep you updated...</P>

<P>Cheers, Andreas</P>

<H3>IRIX</H3>

<P>Use the generic unix arch for those machines that have no  sound
support installed (xmame/xmess uses the dmedia package or the newer
AL package on IRIX systems).</P>

<P>Silicon Graphics provides several native compilers. xmame/xmess
has  been compiled and tested with the normal cc. There were some
problems with this when using -n32 for new style 32bit code. It does
work when using -o32 for oldstyle 32 bit code. It should now also
work with -n32 which is much faster.</P>

<P>The use of DCC is not recommended (anymore) since it's a C++
compiler and thus won't even compile xmame/xmess out of the box
due to uncasted mallocs. Changing all these mallocs would be crazy,
esp. since they are not only in the osd part, but also in the core
which is not under our control. Besides that, mame is normal C, so
please compile it with a normal C compiler.</P>

<P>Some problems have been reported using the GNU linker. It's recommended
that you use the native one.</P>

<H3>HPUX</H3>

<P>Use the generic unix arch. In HP-UX, gcc and gnu-make are MANDATORY.</P>

<H3>ULTRIX </H3>

<P>Use the generic unix arch.</P>

<P>Notes received from Danny <CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es">dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es</A></CODE></P>

<P><B>VERY IMPORTANT!!!</B></P>

<P>The xmame/xmess CPU emulators access memory through pointers
which are sometimes cast to illegal addresses - as far as the MIPS
CPU is concerned. The Ultrix operating system is aware of that and
fixes this &quot;unaligned data access&quot;.</P>

<P>Depending on your system setup, lots of warnings are generated
for certain games. Fortunately these messages can be disabled by
executing the command &quot;uac p 0&quot; in the same shell where
xmame/xmess  will be running.</P>

<P>UPDATE: The new <CODE>-DALIGN_INTS</CODE> switch in the makefile fixes these
unaligned accesses in the source which is probably a lot faster than
hot fixing them in the kernel segfault handler.</P>

<P>Use gnu make.</P>

<P>Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no problems
with compiling and optimizing xmame/xmess, the resulting `c89' 
executable is faster on an empty machine (read: xmame can use all
cpu &amp; memory without competing with other high priority  processes),
so you can set `frameskip' to 1.</P>

<P>When compiling with `c89 -O2' don't forget to also use `-Olimit
1000'. If 1000 is not enough, the compiler will tell you to  increase
it.</P>

<H3>SunOS &amp; Solaris</H3>

<P>There are 2 relevant architecture options available in the makefile:</P>


<P>
<PRE>
    ARCH = generic : use this for old SunOs running on Sparcs,
                     but a Sparc running Solaris will usually
                     handle this option too.
    ARCH = solaris : this is the one you should use for Sparcs
                     running Solaris.        
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Currently sound is not supported under sunos. The solaris arch
does support audio.</P>

<P>If you are using Sun's OpenWindows implementation of X11, then
make sure that the X11INC and X11LIB variables in the X11 Options
section of the makefile are set properly. (There are already entries
for the standard OpenWin directory there that you can uncomment.)</P>

<P>Of course, if you are compiling for X11 then you need to set
these variables properly, no matter what implementation of X11 you
are using!  :)</P>

<P>If you are using Sun's SunPro cc compiler, then the following
optimisation flags have been reported to be good:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
    OPTFLAGS    = -fast -xO4 -native
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Finally, there has been a case of the xmame compilation processes
breaking over the &quot;ar&quot; program. Most Solaris installations
will include a set of utilities that conform to the XPG4 standard,
usually in the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot; directory. The XPG4 version
of &quot;ar&quot; should be avoided like the plague. Ensure that
the &quot;/usr/ccs/bin&quot; appears in your path before the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot;
directory and everything should go smoothly.</P>

<P>PLEASE NOTE : There is currently not much support for SunOS/Solaris.
If you have any trouble, try to fix it yourself. If you succeed,
send a message to the mailing list detailing what you did. If you
don't succeed, send a message anyway and someone _may_ be able to
help you. Either way, this is the only way that problems with xmame
on SunOS/Solaris will get fixed.</P>

<H3>Openstep</H3>

<P>You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must also use
the NeXT/Apple cc rather than gcc. Also use only the optimisation
options as recommended for OpenStep in the makefile, others will
cause the resulting executable to crash. The OpenStep assembler on
i386 architectures is incompatible with the mame assembler CPU cores
and thus you must use the C versions (Use i386-noasm instead of i386
when compiling for i386).</P>

<P>The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which will not
compile src/profiler.c without crashing. To get around this you must
turn off + optimisation when this crash occurs, re-make to compile
this file only, then stop the make, re-enable optimisation, and continue.</P>

<P>On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all operate
as expected. Using the command key in conjuction with a number key
generates the equivalent function key within xmame, with 0, - and
= + representing F10, F11 and F12 resepectively. Also note that the
ALT + keys cannot be mapped. As most games tend to use this as the
default fire button it is exteremly useful to remap this globally
the first time you run xmame.</P>
