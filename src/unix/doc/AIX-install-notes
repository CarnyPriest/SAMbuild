Install Notes for AIX
===========================================

I started out with a bare machine and this is what I had to do to get it
running:

1.) Installed AIX 4.3.3 on a 7043-150 Model Machine

    It should work on most machines without a problem

2.) Installed all the bos.adt filesets from the operating system cd's

   I was missing the 'as' function and this cleared it up.

3.) Installed gcc 2.95.3.0 (Available from http://www.bull.de/pub/)

   It unpacks as a installp package so you can install from 'smit'

4.) Installed gnu-make 3.79.1.0  (Available from http://www.bull.de/pub/)

   Make sure you are running this make and not the AIX one! (Maybe call it
gmake?)

5.) Added  /usr/include to my path directory to help find files

6.) Installed the X11.adt filesets from the operating system cd's

7.) Installed the X11.compat filesets from the operating system cd's

8.) Installed the UMS filesets from the 4.3.3 Bonus Pack Cd's

9). Had to use these lines in the makefile:

     changed 'CFLAGS    = -O -Wall'    into  ' CFLAGS    = -O -Wall
-mminimal-toc'
     to kill off a TOC error when linking
     used the available 'MY_CPU = risc' line
     used the available 'ARCH  = aix' line
     the X11 libraries are here for AIX:
     X11INC                = -I/usr/include/X11
            X11LIB                = -L/usr/lib/X11

9) For some reason I had to edit the nes_def.h file and commented out the
INT=8, INT=16 and INT=32
    lines because it would cough up when compiling.

10) Used  make -f makefile.unix to compile it up.

11) Followed the rest of the readme for setup info
