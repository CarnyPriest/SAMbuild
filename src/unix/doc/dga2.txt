Xmame DGA2 Video Driver Documentation

November 27, 2001.

Before reporting a bug, please
------------------------------
- Check the blacklist below.
- Check at the end of this document for known bugs/behaviour.

Blacklist of buggy XFree86(4.1.0) and Non-Free drivers
------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: These are not xmame's bugs.
mga     - DGA does not work with the Matrox HAL module.
nvidia  - the driver before v0.96 is buggy.
radeon  - only DGA1 works. (already fixed in XFree86 CVS.)
s3virge - all DGA support seems broken. (Use XFree86 3.3.x.)
tdfx    - some people reported DGA does not work with Voodoo3.
          (fixed in XFree86 CVS?)

Tips - DGA1 under XFree86 4.x
-----------------------------
Change the if statement in src/unix/video-drivers/xf86_dga.c at line 62

"else if (i >= 2)" to "else if (0)"

and xmame will now always use DGA1 instead of broken DGA2.
(This is a kluge. Bugs should be reported to XFree86@XFree86.org.)

Known Bugs/Behaviour
--------------------
- Switching to fullscreen DGA mode and then quitting xmame screws up the
  keyboard.  Apparently this has something to do with xmame losing the ctrl or
  alt release codes; pressing ctrl or alt a few times should restore the
  keyboard to a sane state.
