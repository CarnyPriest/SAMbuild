CGAFONT is a program to assist in making a dump of the CGA character
generator ROM.

CGAFONT was written on 4 April 2003 by John Elliott <jce@seasip.demon.co.uk>

Latest version and executable is available at

To use it, you will need an IBM-compatible PC with:
* A CGA (or compatible) video controller.
* DOS.

How it works
============
CGAFONT creates a 2k font in memory. You edit this font until it matches the
character shapes produced by the CGA in text mode. When the two sets of
characters are identical, you have a dump of your CGA character generator ROM.

How to use CGAFONT:
===================
1. Run GRAFTABL (optional, but will make your life easier by providing
  default character shapes).
2. Run CGAFONT. The screen will switch to 40-column mode and show this
display:

     Choose character to edit

        000:

     Cursor keys to select, ENTER to edit
     W to write font dump to disc
     S/T to test with ROM font, ESC to exit

3. Press S or T to compare the font in CGAFONT's memory with the one in the
  CGA ROM. It is not possible to display them both at once (one is drawn in
  text mode, the other in graphics mode) so the display shows one, then the
  other.

  The S option switches between the two once every second, while T switches
as fast as the system can manage. Press ESC to leave the test mode.

  If the two fonts looked identical, then skip to step 6.

4. Using the cursor keys, select a character that looked different in both
  display modes. Press ENTER to edit it.

5. The editing screen will now be displayed. On the left is an enlarged bitmap
  of the character (from CGAFONT's memory); on the right is the one from the
  CGA ROM, drawn at its usual size. Edit the bitmap on the left using the
  cursor keys and SPACE. You can test using S/T on this screen as well; press
  ESC to leave it. Note that you cannot undo changes you have made.

6. Once you are satisfied that the font in CGAFONT's memory matches the one
  in your CGA ROM, press W to write the font dump. This will write a file
  CGAFONT.BIN to the current disc.

7. If your card has more than one font (eg: a genuine IBM CGA card or an
  Amstrad PC1512 built-in CGA) then rename CGAFONT.BIN, set the option links
  for the next font, and repeat.
