### X11 keymapping ###
#
# mapkey	<Xcode>,<Scancode>
#
# Xcode means the HEX code of the key as appears in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
# Scancode means the hexadecimal code that represents the value used for Xmame
# 	in keyboard inputs, as defined in src/unix/keyboard.h xmame source file
# IMPORTANT: 
#	1- Due to some limitations, only LATIN-1 X-codes ( 0x0000-0x00ff ) and
#	Especial X-keycodes ( 0xff00-0xffff ) are supported
#	2- Some keys are keyboard dependent: As Xmame works internally with
#	Standard US-AT keyboard codes, you must take care in remmaping some keys
#

# An example: map space as "firebutton" (Mame predefines it as KEY_LCONTROL)
# in symbolic Xlib/Mame notation it should be:
#
# mapkey XK_space,KEY_LCONTROL 
# 
# So, looking in X11/keysymdef.h and src/unix/keyboard.h, we'll write
# mapkey 0x0020,0x001d
#
# (Other example). To use the F8 key to insert a coin, you should use
# mapkey 0xffc5,0x0006

### SDL keymapping ###
#
# sdlmapkey	<SDLcode>,<Scancode>
#
# SDLcode means the HEX code of the key as it appears in 
#       include/SDL/SDL_keysym.h
# Scancode means the hexadecimal code that represents the value used for Xmame
# 	in keyboard inputs, as defined in src/unix/keyboard.h xmame source file
#

# An example: map space as "firebutton" (Mame predefines it as KEY_LCONTROL)
# in symbolic SDL/Mame notation it should be:
#
# sdlmapkey SDLK_SPACE,KEY_LCONTROL 
# 
# So, looking in X11/keysymdef.h and src/unix/keyboard.h, we'll write
# sdlmapkey 0x0020,0x001d
#
# (Other example). To use the F8 key to insert a coin, you should use
# sdlmapkey 0x0121,0x0006
