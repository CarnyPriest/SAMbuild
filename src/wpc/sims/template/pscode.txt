		  Pinball Simulator Template/Test Matrixes
                  ----------------------------------------

 Use the Pinball Simulator Start Template (PSST.c) to start a brand new
 simulator. You will find help inside the code.

 I've made the Pinball Solenoid Test Matrix (PSTM.c) driver when I was writing
 the simulators for PZ, GI and a few more. The thing is that in some pins the
 motors aren't shown on the "T4. Solenoid Test" menu, and I needed the solenoid
 numbers to simulate their movement. PSTM.c will do the trick.
 There are comments in the code which tell its usage.
