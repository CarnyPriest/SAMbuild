What's new:
-----------

Version 1.10 (December 13, 2001)
-----------------------------------------
This may very well be the most anticipated release of PinMAME to date: 4 Letters - BSMT.

What was once thought nearly impossible has become a reality for PinMAME,
thanks in large part to emulation wizard Aaron Giles(of MAME fame).
35 New Games now have fully working sound!
Thank you to the following for their help and support in trying to emulate the BSMT:
Destruk, Worf, DesAngel, RevenantUK, Guru

Gottlieb games also received a huge update: Finally solved the many issues with getting Gottlieb System 3
games to work. In addition, sound support was added for all System 80b games as well as the newer System 3 games.

As you can also see, we've realized, much like the MAME team, that using Beta naming is
rather tedious and annoying, so we've dropped it. 

We know you'll enjoy this latest version of PinMAME as much as we do!!
