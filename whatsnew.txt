Version 1.32 (May 1, 2004) - "MayDay Edition"
-------------------------------------------------------------
Not a lot of new stuff in here, but this release is needed to ensure people can enjoy
PinMAME for a while without any new glitches that we might introduce by switching
over to the new MAME core architecture started with MAME version 0.79;
We have already ported all the drivers and self-made CPU cores, and we ran into some
serious problems, so this might take a while...

Apart from that, some improvements were made to the existing code, especially for
the GTS80A games. Tom succeeded in emulating the Votrax chip closer to the real thing
than we might ever get, so you will now listen to the original phonemes the chip
produces in all their four possible intonations (try the attract mode of "Cavaleiro
Negro" and wait for him to sing to you...)! :)
Also, the timer bug with the 6532 RRIOT chip was corrected, so we could re-install
the unhacked version of timer.c again. Any slowdown problems on Gottlieb games
should be a thing of the past now, and the slam tilt is working again too.
Tom brought back the long-lost Hankin sound emulation, too. Thanks a lot!

Furthermore, there was a new CPU included that's used on the early Zaccaria
single-player games, like Strike, or Ski Jump: The National Semiconductor SC/MP,
or "Scamp", as it's commonly called... a most peculiar piece of Processor history.

Not much more, I'm afraid. We are all pretty busy lately, and we're missing Steve's
work a lot! Still, have fun playing around with this latest release. :)

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Major improvement to the Votrax SC01 emulation (speech synthesis based
  on samples from the original chip from now on!)
- Gottlieb System 80A games working as supposed, including Slam tilt,
  and without the need for any hacks in the timer section.
- Fixed Hankin sound back to where it was before it was broken.
  [Tom Haukap]

- adjusted the "6" and "9" numbers in Atari & Gottlieb games to look correct
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- Added the 4 missing lamp columns for Williams Firepower
  [Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn]
  
New Features
------------
- new CPU: National Semiconductor SC/MP, needed for early Zaccaria games
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

- some new clones for Taito & Williams games
- Added roms for Stern's "Ripley's Believe It or Not"
  [Brian Smith, Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.31 (December 23, 2003) - Happy 32nd Birthday Steve
-------------------------------------------------------------
They say that history repeats itself, and we would have to agree! 
It was exactly 2 years ago to the day that PinMAME was released with a major new breakthrough in sound
emulation, namely BSMT emulation, at the time.

Today, the major new breakthough is fully working Capcom sound, which will no doubt make this release 
one of the best releases in the history of the project. This achievement was without question the most
difficult challenge ever faced (even more than the original capcom emulation itself). Along with the new
sound support, additional improvements in the capcom emulation, and a major speed increase bring 
the reality of capcom pinball emulation to life like never before.

We also worked around the bug preventing the Gottlieb System 80A games from working introduced with
the 1.30 release; it turned out they worked with the "buggy" timer system from MAME 0.75 alone,
as opposed to all the other games. The games will still lock up on slamming, but that's minor...

Bally games using the "Squalk & Talk" sound also received an update:
Sound is no longer breaking up, or speech becoming garbled during a game.
Maybe it's also sounding a bit closer to the original chip now, but that's not confirmed.

On a bittersweet note, project leader Steve Ellenoff will be retiring from the project as of this release.
With a new child on the way, and massive new real life job committments to meet, he simply doesn't see
much time in his future for contributing to PinMAME. Steve would like to personally thank everyone he's 
worked with over the years who've contributed their time and effort into making PinMAME such a 
great success. He further would like to add that it's been an honor for him to have been at the healm of
one of the coolest software projects ever, and he is thankful to have had the opportunity to help make the
incredible advances the software has made over the years.

Gerrit Volkenborn will be taking over the project lead position and will no doubt continue to 
improve this great project! Not without serious help from Tom & Brian, however... ;)

Happy holidays to everyone and we hope you enjoy our latest release!


Bugs Fixed
----------
- Missing 50V Solenoid Detection in Capcom Games fixed (reports as 99V but that's fine)
- Flipper Football & Kingpin now fire 50V solenoids
- Data East/Sega 192x64 DMD games should now be as fast as they were in version 1.12.2
  (since the 68306 cpu core now no longer slows down the original 68000 cpu emulation)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- TMS5220 speech emulation more reliable & accurate
- Gottlieb System 80A games working again
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]

New Features
------------
- Major speed boost in the 68306 cpu core, which means Capcom emulation is now much faster!
- Fully working Capcom Sound emulation (might still be some minor issues, but overall it's excellent)
- Added multi chip TMS320AV120 MPG Audio Decoder Sound core
- Upgraded 8051 CPU core to handle 8752 CPU core functionality
- Added UART serial port support to 8051 core, plus a few new timer modes
- Implemented 68306 DUART Serial ports & Timer functionality
- Added mostly working X9241 Digital EPot to Capcom Sound board emulation.
- Added multi chip capability to the 6845 CRT video driver (will be needed for Gottlieb Strikes N Spares)
- Added some new features to the debugger (Shift+Enter command, Sound Enabling/Disabling, Stack pointer hilight)
- Changes to allow sound commander to work in debug mode for easier testing
  [Steve Ellenoff]

- Moved to MAME .75 core (.76 for some drivers, depending on the timer implementation)
- Added lots of clones
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
------------------------------
This release is probably one of the most significant releases we've ever had!
With newly added fully working support for Alvin G & Co. and playable Capcom emulation 
we finally have support for all the "well known" manufacturers. Most of the remaining
manufacturers games are very rare or hard to find info on, so in a sense we have pretty
much as complete support for all games as we can get.. Sure some information may pop
up for some of the more obscure manufacturers, and we'll be sure to add them, but most
likely, the current supported hardware is pretty much final.

Additionally, several bugs that have plaqued PinMAME for a very very long time have 
been fixed or worked around, such as the infamous Black Knight sound issues
which are now fully working!

Of course, there's still quite a lot left to do to improve PinMAME, adding Capcom sound
support being one of them. That will be quite complicated and will surely keep us busy
for quite awhile!

Additionally, we've expanded core support for alternate rom revisions so that many older
rom revisions can be used. This change will require some current romsets to be renamed.
Please see the enclosed "alias.txt" file for details, and use the included "romupd.bat"
file to update the names of all affected rom zip files which you are legally entitled to have.

Unfortunately, the switch to the MAME 74 core has created a number of new bugs which we did not have
time to correct before the release (although we tried really hard!). 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will try to correct them as quickly as possible. 
If you find any we're unaware of, please let us know immediately.

One we're very well aware of - and it's driving us crazy - is all of the Gottlieb
System80A games - Devil's Dare to Ice Fever - are NOT working! All regular System80 games
from Spiderman to Eclipse work, however, and it's exactly the same CPU board!? :(

Despite these few little issues, we hope you'll enjoy our latest release which really marks
a very big milestone for us and for PinMAME.

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-----------------------------
Happy late 2nd birthday greetings to PinMAME!
Yes, 2 years and 2 days ago, PinMAME was officially released for the first time.
Hard to believe two years have passed since but then, not so hard when you
look at how much has changed in between!
PinMAME 0.99 didn't have support for a single working Bally game, and look
what it can do today: A total of 548 sets are supported, including 106 clones,
so excluding some test sets, there are some 430 individual working games in there.
Considering the worldwide total of solid state pinball games ever produced is
about 900, I'd say we're right on course... :)

This latest release is a much stabilized version of 1.20, only so much
has changed since that we decided to call the new version 1.21, to avoid
any more confusion than necessary...

Bugs Fixed
----------
- Fixed crashes in some DCS games.
- Removed flipper switches 5 & 7 from Dungeon & Dragons
- Corrected flipper switches for EBC
- Changed Mousin' around display to one row
- Some small fixes in Bally cheap-squeek sound (Black pyramid is still strange)
- Corrected 6809 core bug with CC register and exg + tfr instructions.
  (if a mamedev reads this: the bug is also in mame66)
- Fixed a small port read problem on 6803
- Corrected 68306 cpu emulation (Capcom)
- Merged Hankin driver with bally -35 games
- Rewrote gts80 driver.
- Added support for road kings' muxed slenoids
- mini dmd support for HRC & RCT
- bally video games now use same sound board as other bally games
- Added "special solenoid" handling for Grand Lizard & Space Station
- Added 8259 emulation (slightly modified from MESS source)
  [Martin Adrian]

- Greatly improved lamps in Baby Pacman, although there are still some issues.
- Gottlieb System 3 music and speech FINALLY working!! (Requires hefty system to work perfectly unfortunately)
  [Steve Ellenoff]

  [Martin Adrian, Steve Ellenoff]

- Improved Gottlieb System 80B sound
- Added comma segments to GTS80A games
- Increased CPU speed for Midway's Rotation VIII

  Only used in games that don't use Fliptronics flippers (before TAF)
  but it seems like many later games still activates the signal.
  Can be used to disable bumpers/slingshots in VPM
- Added GameOn and Tilt solenoid for GTS80 games (Sol 10 & 11)
  GameOn is adjusted to mean "game in progress and not tilted"

- Added lots of romsets for bowlers, shuffle alleys, prototypes, some bootlegs too.
  [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.20 Beta (September 29, 2002)
--------------------------------------
The 1.20 version was destined to be the first one to use the new MAME core
and the new driver architecture introduced with MAME 0.58.
We used the MAME 0.59 sources to start with and aligned our own code
to fit this new architecture. This, however, led to massive code changes,
and also to some problems not easily solved!

One of the most prominent setbacks was the new way to trigger interrupts.
Whereas you could simply say "cpu_cause_interrupt()" in the old core, you'd
now have to use "cpu_set_irq_line(HOLD_LINE|ASSERT_LINE|PULSE_LINE)",
followed by "cpu_set_irq_line(CLEAR_LINE)" in case of HOLD_LINE or
ASSERT_LINE, yet not in every single case!
Also there seems to be no distinction between MACHINE_RESET and MACHINE_INIT
as MACHINE_INIT is called every time you press F3 on your keyboard!
Confused? Well, so were we...
On the other hand, the new driver structure is just marvellous when it comes
to include new machine drivers, and we also still want to stick close to the
original MAME code...

Now the end result of all our changes was good, but not perfect!
Some emulations will just freeze when reset (eg. GTS3), others will kill the
task without warning, others will just exit if you reset once too often.
To shorten a long story: we decided to release the new version, most notably
not to deprive you of all the nice new and improved drivers we did! :)
But be advised, we didn't call it a beta version without a good reason!
We'll probably switch to the (more stable and maybe faster?) 0.61 core soon
to see if it helps with some of the troubles we're currently experiencing.
So stay tuned, and enjoy the new stuff!

Version 1.12.2 (September 29, 2002)
-----------------------------------
This is a refreshed version of 1.12.1 WITHOUT any new features or games
(with the exception of Tag-Team Wrestling, which arrived late for the 1.12.1
release). Only the CRCs for bad and newly released ROMs have been corrected.
The 4 Zaccaria games supported by 1.12.1 have been removed, as they weren't
working at all! They will, however, inside PinMAME 1.20 beta and above!

This is a "safety" release to keep everybody up and running, as there are
some unsolved problems with the new M.A.M.E. 0.59 core implementation as
used by the 1.20 beta version. Read the "whatsnew.txt" of 1.20 beta for
closer details!

Bugs Fixed
----------
-Forced commas are back on all games that use them

New Features
------------
-Added support for Gottlieb's "Tag-Team Wrestling"
-Updated all ROM checksums to known good (or bad) values
-Added missing display on Bally's "Medusa"
 [Gerrit Volkenborn]


Version 1.12.1 (April 14, 2002)
-------------------------------
This is just considered a bugfix release for some issues that became apparent
with the 1.12 version. We're going to need more beta testers next time. :)
Only one more game showed up in the meantime, GamePlan's "Vegas".
Apart from that, everything else was a bug fix - more or less;
as some of these "bugs" were hidden pretty deep inside the MAME core -
like the illegal but still deliberately used 6502 opcode that crashed sound
on some Gottlieb games!

The next version will be based upon the 0.59 MAME core, which is a pretty big
change, so it may take a while... ;)

Bugs Fixed
----------
-Sound is back on Harley Davidson
-S11: Solenoids 20 & 21 separated again (Rollergames etc.)
 [Martin Adrian]

-DE: Removed sound bug that crashed Secret Service (and maybe others?)
-GTS3: Corrected key layouts for all games

 [Tom Haukap]

New Features
------------

 [Tom Haukap]

-Atari sound improved (noise generation & different waveforms)
-Added correct support for GamePlan's "Vegas"
 [Gerrit Volkenborn]

-GTS80: Memory mapping and layout should now be 100%
 [Tom Haukap]
 [Martin Adrian]


Version 1.12 (March 29, 2002)
-----------------------------
Happy Birthday to PinMAME! It's hard to believe it's been 1 year since our initial release.
So much has been added in that time, it's really amazing to see how far we've come.
We look forward to another year even better than this one! We'd like to thank everyone for
their continued support and enthusiasm! It's great to see so many pinball fans come together and push to keep our hobby from dying.

Version 1.11 (February 3, 2002)
------------------
A good sized new release with working support from 2 new manufacturers (Hankin & Gameplan), as
well as preliminary support for 1 more (Zaccaria). Of course, we're thrilled to be able to
add working fully working Baby Pacman emulation, which has been a long standing request going back to the
very first few versions of PinMAME.
Finally, we close the book on missing Bally support, by adding working 6803 emulation.
Last but not least, we hope to have solved the sound stuttering/scratchy issues introduced
in version 1.10, but with so many possible configurations, it's hard to know for sure.
So please post on the forum if you still have trouble, and be sure to include your setup.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:
  This release has not been beta tested and may contain many bugs!
  We wanted to get a release out now, because for the next month or so, we won't have time,
  and we thought we should at least get the bugs from last version fixed and out the door.

Version 1.10 (December 23, 2001) - Happy 30th Birthday Steve
------------------------------------------------------------
This may very well be the most anticipated release of PinMAME to date: 4 Letters - BSMT.

What was once thought nearly impossible has become a reality for PinMAME,
thanks in large part to emulation wizard Aaron Giles(of MAME fame).
35 New Games now have fully working sound!
Thank you to the following for their help and support in trying to emulate the BSMT:
Destruk, Worf, DesAngel, RevenantUK, Guru

Gottlieb games also received a huge update: Finally solved the many issues with getting Gottlieb System 3
games to work. In addition, sound support was added for all System 80b games as well as the newer System 3 games.

As you can also see, we've realized, much like the MAME team, that using Beta naming is
rather tedious and annoying, so we've dropped it.

We know you'll enjoy this latest version of PinMAME as much as we do!!
