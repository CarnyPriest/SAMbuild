; This file is used in the sound command mode
; and contains shortcuts for playing sounds
;
; The entries (lines starting with a ':') in this file are grouped
; under different headings (headings end with a ':')
;
; When a game is loaded it will look for entries under the
; following headings:
; dcs:         (for DCS games)
; wpcs:        (for pre-DCS games)
; game_name:   (short game name)
; parent_name: (short parent name)
;
; Example: TZ 9.2 will use the entries under the headings
; wpcs, tz_92, tz_94h
;
; Each entry consist of two parts:
; - Up to 6 bytes command (hexadecimal)
; - The text to display on the screen
;
; Example: Send the command sequence 01 02 03 04 and call it "sequence 1"
; :01020304:Sequence 1
;
; If the same command appear several times the last one in this file
; will be used.
;
; Note that DCS requires an even number of bytes in the command.
