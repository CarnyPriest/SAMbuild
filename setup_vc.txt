-------
General
-------
To use a Visual C++ version for compiling the following is necessary:
- Latest service pack for Visual Studio or Visual C++
- Compatible Windows Platform SDK
- Compatible DirectX SDK (with DirectInput 7)
- Optionally a compatible MSDN Library

Additionally the following is necessary:
- NASM compiler for the assembler parts
  a) Download the assembler compiler NASM to a download directory.
     Binary package:
     * NASM 0.98.39 (Win32)
     Get it from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6208&package_id=47034
     Note: Newer Win32 packages of NASM work too, but the executable has to be
           renamed to "nasmw.exe".
  b) Extract NASM into a separate directory, for example c:\nasm
     Add this directory to the bin directories of Visual C++.


--------------
Visual C++ 6.0 (1998, _MSC_VER = 1200)
--------------
- Microsoft Java Virtual Machine
  For installing Visual Studio 6.0 and its service packs the Microsoft Java
  Virtual Machine (MSJVM) is needed. It is recommended to install one of the
  latest versions (3809 or 3810) first to avoid computer restarts while
  installing the service packs.
  As the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is outdated and insecure it is also
  recommended to deinstall it after installation of all service packs. For this
  Microsoft provided the tool UNMSJVM.EXE.
  Unfortunately the files are nomore available at Microsoft's homepage, but they
  are all available for download at MDGx homepage:
    http://www.mdgx.com/add.htm#JVM
  More information about MSJVM is available at Mark Salloway's Windows Resource
  Center and Virtualmachine:
    http://www.mvps.org/marksxp/WindowsXP/java.php
    http://www.xs4all.nl/~smuller/VMSite2/
- Service Packs & Processor Pack
  Service Pack 5 is needed to update all components of Visual Studio 6.0, the
  Processor Pack for getting MASM and Service Pack 6 for the latest updates of
  Visual C++ and Visual Basic.
  a) Download SP5, the Processor Pack and SP6
     Update Homepage: http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/aa336441.aspx
     6.0 SP5: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e9411283-c8ad-4283-8d74-3d6efd917644
     6.0 PP: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx
             http://www.infinitefactors.org/jonk/pctools.html
     6.0 SP6: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a8494edb-2e89-4676-a16a-5c5477cb9713
  b) Install SP5, then the Processor Pack and at last SP6
     The Processor Pack only installs on SP5, so it is recommended to apply SP5
     first, then the Processor Pack and finally SP6:
       http://support.microsoft.com/kb/872907
     If SP6 is already installed, but you forgot to apply SP5 before and use
     several other components of Visual Studio too, then it is recommended to do
     a re-installation of Visual Studio.
- Windows Platform SDK
  For PinMAME use the SDK coming with Visual C++ 6.0, due to the following ATL
  issue with newer versions: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243298/en-us
- DirectX SDK Summer 2003 Edition
  (folders: utilities, include, lib)
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9216652f-51e0-402e-b7b5-feb68d00f298
- Last MSDN Library with Visual Studio 6.0 information/integration was October 2001.
- Project Files (.dsp) are maintained in the repository

Visual C++ 2002 (7.0, _MSC_VER = 1300, ".NET")
Visual C++ 2003 (7.1, _MSC_VER = 1310)

  2003 SP1: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/results.aspx?categoryid=10&freetext=visual+studio+2003+SP&sortCriteria=date
- Windows Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2 from March 2006
  (folders: bin\winnt, bin, include, lib)
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=E15438AC-60BE-41BD-AA14-7F1E0F19CA0D
- Last DirectX SDK with DirectInput 7, and therefore working with the PinMAME
  source code, is August 2007.
  (folders: $(DXSDK_DIR)utilities\bin\x86, $(DXSDK_DIR)include, $(DXSDK_DIR)lib\x86)
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571
- Last MSDN Library with Visual Studio 2002 information/integration was
  January 2003, but January 2006 should work too.
- Last MSDN Library with Visual Studio 2003 information/integration was
  January 2006.
- Project Files (.vcproj) for VC2002 are maintained in the repository
  As the VC2003 format is the same as VC2002 (except for the version nummber)
  just create a copy of each VC2002 project files and rename them to VC2003.
  Then replace all occurrences of VC2002 in them with VC2003.
  Finally convert them with VC2003.
  A batch file is provided to assist you with the copying.

Visual C++ 2005 (8.0, _MSC_VER = 1400)
Visual C++ 2008 (9.0, _MSC_VER = 1500)

- Service Packs
  2005 SP1: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/results.aspx?categoryid=10&freetext=visual+studio+2005+SP&sortCriteria=date
- Windows Platform SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 from March 2008

- Last DirectX SDK with DirectInput 7, and therefore working with the PinMAME
  source code, is August 2007.

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571
- Current MSDN Library works with both versions.
  First MSDN Library with Visual Studio 2005 information/integration was April 2006.
- Project Files (.vcproj)
  As the VC2005/2008 format is similar to VC2002 just create a copy of each
  VC2002 project file and rename them to VC2005 or VC2008.
  Then replace all occurrences of VC2002 in them with VC2005 or VC2008 respectively.
  Finally convert them with VC2005 or VC2008.
  Add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to the C/C++ preprocessor definitions in all builds.
  A batch file is provided to assist you with the copying.

Additional notes on Express Editions:
- Both (2005 & 2008) work fine without any changes and can compile PinMAME and PinMAME32
- The Express Editions are lacking the resource editors and also support for ATL
  and MFC projects. VPinMAME is an ATL DLL project (Release = MinDependency) and
  therefore not compilable with a normal Express Edition setup.
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hs24szh9.aspx
- Through investigations we found out that it is possible to compile VPinMAME
  with the Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition and using a "trick":
  Install the 90-day Trial Version of Visual C++ 2008 *and* the Express Edition.
  With the trial version you get all the ATL and MFC includes plus libraries.
  The Express Edition still contains all the configurations settings to use these.
  This way you can compile existing ATL and MFC projects, but you can not create
  a new ATL or MFC project as the corresponding wizard definitions are missing
  for the Express Edition.
  Btw this "trick" failed with the Express Edition of VisualC++ 2005.

Compilation
-----------
- Directly load a project file (*.dsp or .vcproj), choose between Release or
  Debug build and then compile.


-------------------
Addendum: Libraries
-------------------
- The ZLib library for Visual C++ 6.0 is already included in the CVS repository.
  If you want to compile it yourself then get the following package:
  a) ZLib source code
     * zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz
     Get it from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=14274
     Note: Newer versions of ZLib work too (currently 1.2.3).
  b) If you want to test the assembler optimised version you also need MASM from
     Microsoft. You can use it for free, but not for commercial use.
     Get the Processor Pack for Visual C++ 6.0:
     * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx
     * http://www.infinitefactors.org/jonk/pctools.html
     Extract it to a temporary directory, for example c:\masm, copy the
     following files into a separate directory and it to the bin directories of
     Visual C++:
     * H2INC.ERR
     * H2INC.EXE
     * ML.ERR
     * ML.EXE
     * MASMREF.DOC
