How to setup Visual C++ to compile PinMAME (all flavours)
=========================================================

ToDo:
* ISO C99 and C90 issues (msc.h include), VS2008 is currently used by developmen team, but batch scripts and infos are available for older VS versions
* Re-check first and last supported versions of WSDK, MSDN, etc. for all VS versions

-------
General
-------
To use a Visual C++ version for compiling the following is necessary:
- Latest service pack for Visual Studio or Visual C++
- Compatible Windows Platform SDK
- Compatible DirectX SDK (with DirectInput 7)
- Optionally a compatible MSDN Library
  or a free MSDN Lib
  MSDN Library für Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (April 2009)
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7bbe5eda-5062-4ebb-83c7-d3c5ff92a373
- Checksum Integrity Verification
  https://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290 

Additionally the following is necessary:
- NASM compiler for the assembler parts
  a) Download the assembler compiler NASM 2.0 for Win32 to a download directory.
     Binary package:
     * nasm-2.02-win32 (later versions should work too)
     Get it from http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
  b) Extract NASM into a separate directory, for example c:\nasm
     Note: If an older NASM Win32 package is used (<0.99.4), then rename the
           executables to "nasm.exe" and "ndisasm.exe" by removing the W letter.
  c) Add this directory to the bin directories of Visual C++.

Update 2015-08: Microsoft has removed support for VS/VC 6.0 completely, all download and documentation links are now disfunctional

--------------
Visual C++ 6.0 (1998, _MSC_VER = 1200)
--------------
- Microsoft Java Virtual Machine
  For installing Visual Studio 6.0 and its service packs the Microsoft Java
  Virtual Machine (MSJVM) is needed. It is recommended to install one of the
  latest versions (3809 or 3810) first to avoid computer restarts while
  installing the service packs.
  As the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is outdated and insecure it is also
  recommended to deinstall it after installation of all service packs. For this
  Microsoft provided the tool UNMSJVM.EXE.
  Unfortunately the files are nomore available at Microsoft's homepage, but they
  are all available for download at MDGx homepage:
    http://www.mdgx.com/add.htm#JVM
  More information about MSJVM is available at Mark Salloway's Windows Resource
  Center and Virtualmachine:
    http://www.mvps.org/marksxp/WindowsXP/java.php
    http://www.xs4all.nl/~smuller/VMSite2/
- Service Packs & Processor Pack
  Service Pack 5 is needed to update all components of Visual Studio 6.0, the
  Processor Pack for getting MASM and Service Pack 6 for the latest updates of
  Visual C++ and Visual Basic.
  a) Download SP5, the Processor Pack and SP6
     Update Homepage: (non-functional) http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/aa336441.aspx
     6.0 SP5: (non-functional) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718363.aspx

              (seems that Microsoft has removed Service Pack 5 although it is needed for the Processor Pack)
              http://ftp.maddes.net/vs6/
     6.0 PP: (non-functional) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx
             (non-functional) http://www.infinitefactors.org/jonk/pctools.html

  b) Install SP5, then the Processor Pack and at last SP6
     The Processor Pack only installs on SP5, so it is recommended to apply SP5
     first, then the Processor Pack and finally SP6:
       http://support.microsoft.com/kb/872907
     If SP6 is already installed, but you forgot to apply SP5 before and use
     several other components of Visual Studio too, then it is recommended to do
     a re-installation of Visual Studio.

Additional notes on Express Editions:
- Both (2005 & 2008) work fine without any changes and can compile PinMAME and PinMAME32
  http://www.microsoft.com/express/
  VS 2008 SP1 Express: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=3254c868-bcb9-412c-95c6-d100c872ec60
- The Express Editions are lacking the resource editors and also support for ATL
  and MFC projects. VPinMAME is an ATL DLL project (Release = MinDependency) and
  therefore not compilable with a normal Express Edition setup.
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hs24szh9.aspx
- Through investigations we found out that it is possible to compile VPinMAME
  with the Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition by using a "trick":
  Install the 90-day Trial Version of Visual C++ 2008 *and* the Express Edition.
  With the trial version you get all the ATL and MFC includes plus libraries.
  The Express Edition still contains all the configuration settings to use these.
  This way you can compile existing ATL and MFC projects, but you can not create
  a new ATL or MFC project as the corresponding wizard definitions are missing
  in the Express Edition.
  Btw this "trick" failed with the Express Edition of VisualC++ 2005.

  - Difference between MSDN release and trial ISOs is only the product key in "Setup\setup.sdb", and sometimes depending on the language the DVD name.
    So the trial ISO has the full retail content and can be unlimited with a key.

Compilation
-----------
- Directly load a project file (*.dsp or .vcproj), choose between Release or
  Debug build and then compile.


----------------
Virtual Machines (or placing intermediate files somewhere else)
----------------
The project files for VC++ 2002 (and later) allow to place the intermediate
files into a separate location. This can be very useful if you get the error
"fatal error C1090: PDB API call failed, error code '23'", which can happen
quite a lot in virtual machines with shared folders.

To use a different location just set the environment variable VS_OUTPUT to the
desired location plus a backslash. A trailing backslash is MANDATORY if you use it!!!
If you set or changed the environment variable while Visual Studio was running,
then you have to exit and restart Visual Studio for the change to take effect.

If the environment variable VS_OUTPUT is not set or empty, then the OBJ folder
will be inside the project folder as usual.


-------------------
Addendum: Libraries
-------------------
- The ZLib library for Visual C++ 6.0 is already included in the CVS repository.
  If you want to compile it yourself then get the following package:
  a) ZLib source code
     * zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz
     Get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.1.4/
     Note: Newer versions of ZLib work too (currently 1.2.3).
  b) If you want to test the assembler optimised version you also need MASM from
     Microsoft. You can use it for free, but not for commercial use.
     Get the Processor Pack for Visual C++ 6.0:
     * (non-functional) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx
     * (non-functional) http://www.infinitefactors.org/jonk/pctools.html
     Extract it to a temporary directory, for example c:\masm, copy the
     following files into a separate directory and add it to the bin directories
     of Visual C++:
     * H2INC.ERR
     * H2INC.EXE
     * ML.ERR
     * ML.EXE
     * MASMREF.DOC
	 Versions:
	 * 6.14 from Win 98 DDK
	 * 6.15 from Processor Pack for Visual C++ 6.0
	 * There's also a 8.0 from Microsoft Downloads
