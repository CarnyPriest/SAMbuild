How to setup MinGW to compile PinMAME/32
========================================

Notes

The file "src\windows\setup.txt" is the original text delivered by MAME and is
out of date. Please ignore it.

PinMAME is build on MAME version 0.76 and with MinGW 2.0 / GCC 3.2.
It has been maintained to compile with more recent MinGW packages too, but
GCC 3.2 is still mandatory.

This guide will show you how to setup MinGW in version 2.0 and a setup with more
recent MinGW packages, so you can compile PinMAME and PinMAME32.

-----------------
Step 1: Downloads
-----------------
- Create a directory to hold all your downloads; for example, c:\mingw-setup

- Decide if you want to use a MinGW 2.0 setup or a more recent one:
  a) MinGW 2.0
     Download MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
     Unfortunately it is not available at the official project homepage anymore.
     Get it from http://www.pinmame.com/downloads.html
     or from http://ftp.maddes.net/mingw/

  b) More recent MinGW setup
     Download the following binary packages to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
     The packages carry the version numbers as of the date of testing, but newer
     packages should work too:

     (MinGW 5 tested in October 2009)
     * mingwrt-3.16-mingw32-dll
     * mingwrt-3.16-mingw32-dev
     * binutils-2.19.1-mingw32-bin
     * make-3.81-20090914-mingw32-bin
     * w32api-3.13-mingw32-dev
     * libz-1.2.3-1-mingw32-dev

     (MinGW 5 tested in March 2009)
     * mingwrt-3.15.2-mingw32-dll
     * mingwrt-3.15.2-mingw32-dev
     * binutils-2.19.1-mingw32-bin
     * mingw32-make-3.81-20080326-3
     * w32api-3.13-dev

     (MinGW 5 tested in May 2008)
     * mingw-runtime-3.14
     * binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1
     * mingw32-make-3.81-20080326-2
     * w32api-3.11

     Get them from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
            and/or http://sourceforge.jp/projects/mingw/releases/?fulllist=1

- Download the latest version of GCC 3.2 for MinGW to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
  Binary package:
  * gcc-3.2.3-20030504-1
  Get it from http://ftp.maddes.net/mingw/gcc-3.2.3-20030504-1.tar.gz
  Warning: GCC 3.4 works too, but due to stricter checks more warnings are
           found, so PinMAME only compiles if you remove "-Werror" from the
           makefile. Removing "-Werror" is not recommended!!!

- Download the latest version of Allegro's DirectX includes for MinGW to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
  Package:
  * dx70_mgw.zip
  Get it from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/
  Note: Newer versions of Allegro's DirectX includes work too (currently dx80_mgw.zip).

- Download some GNU tools for MAME to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
  Binary package:
  * mame-gnulike.exe
  Get it from http://www.mamedev.org/tools/#hard

- Download the assembler compiler NASM to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
  Binary package:
  * NASM 0.98.39 (Win32)
  Get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm/files/Win32%20binaries/0.98.39/
  Note: Newer Win32 packages of NASM work too, but you have to rename the
        executable to "nasmw.exe".

- If you are not using the MinGW release of the zlib library (libz), then
  download the source code of the library ZLib to your c:\mingw-setup directory.
  Package:
  * zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz
  Get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.1.4/
  Note: Newer versions of ZLib work too (currently 1.2.3).


-------------
Step 2: Setup
-------------
- Attention!!! Whenever you extract a .tar.gz or .zip file then always extract
               it including its directory structure, otherwise it won't work.

- Depending if you want to use a MinGW 2.0 setup or a more recent one:
  a) MinGW 2.0
     Run the MinGW installer; install to a logical path, for example c:\mingw

  b) More recent MinGW setup
     Create a directory to hold your MinGW installation; for example, c:\mingw
     Extract all binary packages of MinGW to your c:\mingw directory.

     (MinGW 5 tested in October 2009)
     * mingwrt-3.16-mingw32-dll
     * mingwrt-3.16-mingw32-dev
     * binutils-2.19.1-mingw32-bin
     * make-3.81-20090914-mingw32-bin
     * w32api-3.13-mingw32-dev
     * libz-1.2.3-1-mingw32-dev

     (MinGW 5 tested in March 2009)
     * mingwrt-3.15.2-mingw32-dll (for the DLL itself)
     * mingwrt-3.15.2-mingw32-dev (for includes and libs)
     * binutils-2.19.1-mingw32-bin
     * mingw32-make-3.81-20080326-3
     * w32api-3.13-src (Warning! Creates an extra subfolder, so files have to be moved up)
     * w32api-3.13-dev

     (MinGW 5 tested in May 2008)
     * mingw-runtime-3.14
     * binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1
     * mingw32-make-3.81-20080326-2
     * w32api-3.11

- Extract the GCC 3.2 binary package to your to c:\mingw directory.
  Some files must be overwritten (e.g. "bin\c++filt.exe")

- Extract Allegro's DirectX includes to your to c:\mingw directory.

- Run the MAME GNU tools installer; install to the bin folder of your c:\mingw directory, e.g. c:\mingw\bin

- Extract NASM into a temporary directory, for example c:\mingw-setup\nasm
  Copy these files into your c:\mingw\bin directory:
    - c:\mingw-setup\nasm\nasmw.exe
    - c:\mingw-setup\nasm\ndisasmw.exe
  Note: Another way is to use a separate folder for NASM and add it as a path, e.g. c:\nasm

  Note: If you use a newer Win32 packages, then you have to rename the
        executables to "n[dis]asmw.exe".

- Change your environment variables to add c:\mingw\bin as a path
  If you used a separate folder for NASM, then also add it as a path.

  Note: If you want to use different MinGW versions, then it is recommended to
        use batch files to set the pathes instead of changing the environment
        variables permanently.
        Example "mingw2.bat":
          - path c:\mingw2\bin;%path%
        Example "mingw_gcc32.bat":
          - path c:\mingw_gcc32\bin;%path%
        Call the batch files depending on the MinGW version you want to use.


-----------------
Step 3: Libraries
-----------------
- This step is only necessary if you are not using the MinGW release of the zlib
  library (libz).

- Extract the ZLib source into a temporary directory.
  Change to the ZLib source directory and type "mingw32-make -f nt\makefile.gcc"
  Type "mingw32-make test -f nt\Makefile.gcc" to check its functionality.
  Copy the resulting libz.a to the lib directory in your c:\mingw directory
  Copy zlib.h and zconf.h to the include directory in your c:\mingw directory

  Notes for ZLib 1.2.3:
  - The makefile is "win32\makefile.gcc"
  - The test may fail due to normal slashes in the makefile.
    Just replace "./" with ".\" in it and it will work.
  - Copy libzdll.a to MinGW's lib directory too.
    (not necessary for PinMAME, but for the sake of completeness)


-------------------
Step 4: Compilation
-------------------
- Change to the PinMAME source directory
- To compile PinMAME type "mingw32-make"
- To compile PinMAME32 type "mingw32-make WINUI=1 SUFFIX=32"
- To compile a debug build of these, which also includes the MAME debugger, just
  add "DEBUG=1"
